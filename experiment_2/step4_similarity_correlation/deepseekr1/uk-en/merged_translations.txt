Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äî and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the deoccupied territories.
Direct speech: ‚ÄúMariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äî we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the table of negotiations will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to return even to the cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and may not even be interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...‚Äù
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but ‚Äúwe should not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them.‚Äù
Direct speech: ‚ÄúPeople will perceive peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something ‚Äî and I do not think that they will be satisfied by any peace under any conditions.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äî but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust, when there is nothing, there are no people.‚Äù

We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Bulob is wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of brutal mockery of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century? How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. What happens is exactly what I was sadly waiting for...
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communal-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU gave a copy of the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor ‚Äúone-yard‚Äù gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to dend the plowman and feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and all but two were killed, who agreed to give perjury.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KDBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls...
The three who condemned the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like ‚ÄúImmortal barrack‚Äù, qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDIst found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers ‚Äî the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems on the computer found files with child pornography, for it put in prison, and there already quickly died.
KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16-19th centuries were superimposed on top of the millennial Horde tradition.
And then over what happened, made a brutal genetic experiment, carving out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film ‚ÄúChekist‚Äù in 1992, so it was.
So you saw my photos in a swimsuit

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also howitzers in option on the armored personnel carrier Boxer for 1,2 billion euros are offered.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is this us in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

Maybe I can be something useful for them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also very much hope for this
And so she is very happy about any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...

So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke about ‚Äúthe common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äî it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.‚Äù
If ‚Äúthe evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.‚Äù
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of its blocked cities and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles executions in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans have seen it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany delays delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But ‚ÄúNever again!‚Äù means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you at no time
We agree, agree for the tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents supported.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the outbreak of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens ‚Äî more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance provided by NATO in the context of war, there is now a lot of criticism about the Alliance and member-countries ‚Äî for the late supply of weapons, refusal to close the skies, and the reluctance to ‚Äúirritate‚Äù Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast ‚ÄúDamn Questions‚Äù, together with the editor of ‚ÄúEuropean Truth‚Äù we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think that here
I have a volt partner indicated that my application is pending.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to him, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time we talked a lot.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I wondered, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say ‚Äúthey haven't done this before‚Äù
Konashenkov's direct speech: ‚ÄúWe see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.‚Äù
Russians struck missile strikes to Kiev from the first days of full-scale invasion of occupation troops of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorohozhychi near Babi Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the building of the Ministry of Defense over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed rocket of the invaders crushed the house and the trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who were evacuating from the city to return.
Military explained to local authorities that Russians still can strike rocket attacks to Kiev, and besides on suburbs of the capital there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod said that a ‚ÄúUkrainian shell‚Äù allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this refined fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I do not want to be considered fraudsters.
The funds that you collect, it is better to give to people who are more in need.

They are heroic leaders who go to the war zone without fear, calm and help refugees in cars, and help volunteers to load humanitarian aid in the cars at peace stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhitomir highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are housing and communal services who under attacks take out garbage, repair water supply systems and power lines to provide people necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (HEI of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] on which there are Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo). [ 1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas constituency is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national elections are held in the Foreign constituency: elections of the President and People's Deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.

The head of the President's Office, Andrei Yermak, said that Russia is launching a ‚Äúfake operation‚Äù on weapons handed over to us by the Allies.
Yermak's direct speech: ‚ÄúThey understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to ‚Äúknock down‚Äù the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the destruction of the S-300 SAM systems transmitted by Slovakia.
This information was already denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers seem to surrender with weapons from allies, and it is massively switching to the arming of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these messages as ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù.
‚ÄúReports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are condemned,‚Äù New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
‚ÄúRussia must answer the world for what they have done,‚Äù she added, noting that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida called the incidents ‚Äúa violation of international law.‚Äù
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops committed ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù in Bucha.
‚ÄúWhat happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,‚Äù Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez said that Russian troops can go so far that they committed a ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in Bucha.
‚ÄúWe will do our best to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,‚Äù Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry's Foreign Ministry's speaker Maria Zakharova rejected the accusations as a ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO ‚Äúordered‚Äù the image to discredit Russia.
‚ÄúIn this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who ‚Äúordered‚Äù this story,‚Äù Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is ‚Äúanother statement of the Kiev regime‚Äù and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called ‚Äúprovocation of the Ukrainian radicals‚Äù in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement announcing an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù on charges of spreading Ukraine ‚Äúknowingly false information‚Äù about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
‚ÄúI want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,‚Äù Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head,‚Äù he said.
He declared that the president of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Russian military have to bear responsibility for actions of troops in Ukraine.
‚ÄúWhen we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand,‚Äù he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers north-west of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small town bodies like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äî all in civilian ‚Äî were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
‚ÄúThey were told: There is no Kiev.‚Äù How invaders sneakly exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äî the removal of local population to the enemy's territory.
Since mid-March, Russian occupiers have been ‚Äúevacuating‚Äù Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
‚ÄúUkrainska Pravda‚Äù found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same ‚Äúevacuation‚Äù is going on and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport ‚ÄúAntonov‚Äù, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina in advance collected alarming suitcases, but in the morning of February 24 did not have time to evacuate.
The car in them wasn't, and suburban buses already took nobody.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the next house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
‚ÄúAt 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke not in Russian and not Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: ‚ÄúThere is someone?‚Äù ‚Äî I say yes. ‚Äî ‚ÄúCome out!‚Äù.
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All men were interrogated, whether they served in army.
Women were told: ‚ÄúWe came to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov.‚Äù
It was the Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: ‚ÄúHere we were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (commanded the detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO ‚ÄúViking‚Äù, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we came to help you.‚Äù
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, it was a big problem.
They broke shop, took away from there goods under the pretext ‚Äúall the same Russians will take away‚Äù and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: ‚ÄúWe understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.‚Äù
Nobody really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, ‚ÄúYou have 7 days to give our phones‚Äù ‚Äî they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was they who came, because they did not want wars, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: ‚ÄúPutin is a freak, Kadyrov, too, but we can do nothing because our families are there.‚Äù
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äî their white scotch tape and called it ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù.
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: ‚ÄúDo you have artillery?‚Äù
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äî ours constantly got into it from Bayraktarov.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù, and, according to them, ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative ‚ÄúKyiv has already surrendered‚Äù has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian came to us ‚Äî either an officer of the landing troops, or a representative of the FSB ‚Äî and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äî there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe we were given a ‚Äúgreen corridor‚Äù.
From the very beginning we handed over to the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: ‚ÄúYou are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.‚Äù
We say that we do not want neither there nor there.
To which they answered: ‚ÄúPity the psyche of your children!‚Äù
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äî either Gradami or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that this is for traitors of the homeland - they say, ‚Äúyou will be shot there, they will sell them to the authorities.‚Äù
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnout, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians told that the Russians immediately took out the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint ‚ÄúKomar‚Äù we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! The rocket shoots, and you can see a trace ‚Äî it worked ‚ÄúIskander‚Äù in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, ‚ÄúNo, these are planes flying, turning around at the border.‚Äù
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded on a bus and taken to the sanatorium ‚ÄúChonki‚Äù near Gomel.
His leader, Vasily Stepanovich Venger, came, said: ‚ÄúHere, I'm a crest, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these of your theirs are finished.
Poorish people are suffering!
And Lukashenka is so good at us!
He will say so.‚Äù
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: ‚ÄúYou are already traitors!‚Äù
And people from the Red Cross and the UN Mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had it on Monday to receive, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will tell that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
In sanatorium force didn't hold.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äî UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who took the bus in Mozyr, told that Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was being brought in.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, ‚ÄúYou lie, we are peaceful people.‚Äù
They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting for Poland, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are now, probably, as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones.‚Äù
Marina lived on the territory of a military camp in Gostomel together with her brother's family ‚Äî his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äî the house is no longer there.
Anybody really knew nothing about evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center you can not?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thank you for the agreement, the moths are beautiful
And in this small apartment does not catch wifi, basically I answer all your questions and now I do not know how to be? And children from Monday classes online, but there is no Internet.
That is, I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is it a family ready to receive us?
In the Qur'an it is written: ‚Äúeven a leaf of wood falls from his knowledge.‚Äù
Children are trained online, I am a seller and cook by profession, but I can work in the field and a cleaner that is, a handyman, Mariana an eyelash extension specialist, she can work at home, and the friend Mariana has no specialty, that is, a handyman
Can you agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk said the good news - the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day invaders were thrown out from all Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found killed and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found on the sides of the road 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He told about it in interview to the Associated Press which excerpts were published by Office of the President, writes ‚ÄúEuropean truth‚Äù.
‚ÄúAll the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So what, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,‚Äù Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered: ‚ÄúNot yet, not yet.‚Äù
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different look.
‚ÄúIt would unfold differently, we would have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,‚Äù he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer

‚ÄúFor a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law information about the war.
So far, it succeeds.
However, Plamka (cat - UP) has fur on the belly and hind legs - this can be due to stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, alas.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.‚Äù
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and most of the time spends in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her ‚Äúincognito‚Äù for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
‚Äú33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was near - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spilled out, I gave her the receiver ‚Äî she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.‚Äù
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hears badly ‚Äî it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her ‚Äúwalking‚Äù, I was hiding in my room.
The first thing I hid from her receiver and TV.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
I asked to talk to her about anything, but not about war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It was April 17 - I have a cleaning of 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I did not think about it somehow:)
Hello, if tomorrow we will need our help we can come
Lunch must be ordered, is it possible to take lunch from home? These documents need to be printed, whether they will print out there on the spot and I will sign?
I offer haircuts for men, women, children with a trip to you, all marked please write in private messages, the price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation, I will still look here.
I tell you embassies there are only here,
Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton who is a serviceman of Marine Corps brigade of Armed forces of Ukraine participating in defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they will lay down arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page of Adin Aislin, a British man who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News referring to the words of Aislin's friend who spoke to him
Literally, Eislin's twitter: ‚ÄúWe received the news from him: ‚Äú48 days have passed, we tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.‚Äù
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Journalists of the Air Force contacted the mother of the serviceman Anne Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
Military friend Brenan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about the plans of their unit to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of the Atlas News outlet contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender captive to Russian units, so as not to get into the hands of the so-called ‚ÄúKadyrovites‚Äù detachments without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Aislin allegedly talks to his friend, an American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company ‚ÄúVagner‚Äù.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to fight against terrorists of the so-called ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
A very interesting tradition you have, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled ‚ÄúOn monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere‚Äù.
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the field of economy was... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äî it is an excellent basis for ‚Äúdemolishing‚Äù all the assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual control.
The one that was before 2015.
Why state companies have supervisory boards and who should enter them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law ‚Äúflies‚Äù under patriotic slogans, others may take off tomorrow ‚Äî for example, the public procurement system can be demolished through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide the offers how to resolve an issue of management of state enterprises during war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the members of the supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the opportunity to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
MP, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: ‚Äúmany enterprises, in particular the defense industry complex (defense industry), are now in need of relocation‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúit is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information‚Äù.
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù, in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in ‚ÄúUkroboronroma‚Äù belongs to the CEO, who by the way will make a decision on the need to relocate a particular defense enterprise, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as ‚Äúemotional‚Äù.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to sort out some of them: ‚Äúrespectable foreign experts at the first word ‚Äúwar‚Äù leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war.‚Äù
Firstly, it is manipulation ‚Äî most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they ‚Äúleave Ukraine‚Äù, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of conducting online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Nor should we forget that membership on the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshhorod and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a tightened curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: ‚ÄúIn the settlements of Brovary, Vyshhorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.‚Äù
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to travel by transport and on foot.
Residents can go outside only during an alarm to go to the shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äî to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget for several years in a row grew exponentially.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the Russian Federation's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: ‚ÄúRadyo Svaboda‚Äù, human rights center ‚ÄúViasna‚Äù, chief of criminal militia of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich who quotes state news agency ‚ÄúBelTA‚Äù
In the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30 with power support of special forces of ‚ÄúSOBR‚Äù three inhabitants of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to ‚ÄúVyasna‚Äù, during detention men showed active resistance and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with medical care on the spot.
The chief of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that ‚Äúacts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will rigidly stop‚Äù by security officers using the weapon.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of ‚ÄúBJD‚Äù and the administrator of thematic resources ‚ÄúBJD‚Äù in ‚ÄúVKontakte and ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railroad workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of ByPol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to commit sabotage at the railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian ‚Äúrail guerrillas‚Äù thus try to resist the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring manpower and equipment to Ukraine to fight.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
‚ÄúThis step is based on the decision adopted by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms,‚Äù the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these entities and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including Russian ex-president and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.

Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a little information from Mariupol for the son - live and in a system.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Corps Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded people.
They said that ‚Äúthe bill goes for hours.‚Äù
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate Marine Corps Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could become the last battle for defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command didn't contact the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyi assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers in the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù Andrey Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the regiment ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we stay here

The squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones from today began flights over Ukraine üá∫üá¶.
Almost 50 professional copters üöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader üí•.
Two Zakarpatye and two Czech brothers ‚Äúbirds‚Äù to Ukraine sent the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends headed by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones to their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, we will leave their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say that in the coming days many more interesting ‚Äúgifts‚Äù will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the invaders made fun of the memorial ‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine‚Äù in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown people broke the flag of the European Union, destroyed the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Demolished the flag.

Headquarters report: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine ‚Äúof aggression against a neighboring state‚Äù.
Literally: ‚ÄúIt is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state‚Äù.
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Allegedly, in the next few days, invaders will try to resume offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Armaments and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent location of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel are recruited from the brigade.
The enemy experiences a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected staff from point of constant dislocation is planned for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt delivery of goods to places of warfare, will continue blows to objects of transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine for the purpose of their destruction or disabling.
The identified units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and moved to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Gold, had no success.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopole, Trudolyubovka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Do not understand your thoughts?
Of course, we will try to make it, but I doubt
And you can do you want to sleep and I hold you
You definitely do not mind, that I came?
maybe you just have no desire to see you today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and especially 1+1. We do not need to set up:)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
I have a monthly tariff package expires today:)
Can we do that today on the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, be sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in its own way üèµÔ∏è., I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we are things that you brought, but there are things that are small on us, can you bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the Labour Office to submit documents (if it works, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it is raining:)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work for Tevi
Friends are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I've been in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you run away from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is being exposed on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from ‚ÄúMemorial‚Äù.
I will tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered laconically. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.
Others ‚Äî cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äî are amazed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
Neither of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äî those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduga, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äî have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except unless participation in meetings when they still occurred.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist ‚ÄúIt's too late to hide, too late to be silent‚Äù
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive compassion, which now, probably, have a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you, to a certain extent, possessed freedom and democracy ‚Äî disorderly, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year in 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you end up being overwhelmed by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems to you that it is safer near him. Why so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans from the Stasi, you took your soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky ‚Äî and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were confronted with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option ‚Äî and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya again with the ground, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's ‚Äúanti-terrorist operation‚Äù, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Qali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: ‚ÄúBrad, we are already tired of your Chechnya.‚Äù I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: ‚ÄúFriends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.‚Äù
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found a better job.
Prices grew, but is it a trouble?
Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.
When several oppositionists ‚Äî Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äî were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of the prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if we did anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what significance did Russia blatantly violate international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to protests.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
‚ÄúWhat could we do?‚Äù
I've heard it so often and I've heard it so far.
‚ÄúThe state is so strong, and we are so weak.‚Äù
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan ‚Äî and never left it.
They completely independently built a tent camp and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
In the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general dismay, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his band suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
‚ÄúWe are not interested in politics,‚Äù you said.
And you new hid in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbegs, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äî and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and myself saw how on the streets of Homs state snipers coldly shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:
‚ÄúAt first they came to the Socialists, but I kept silent ‚Äî because I am not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I kept silent because I'm not a union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silent, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say something in my defense.‚Äù
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äî like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new GULAG or form a company for Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians ‚Äî or, what seems very likely, if he does not succeed ‚Äî he will take over you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went out to protest and still took place for a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for an anecdote, are not in such a distant past ‚Äî and now they are very likely waiting for you in the future.
Who then will speak out for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äî even more than in 2014 ‚Äî frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on the alert.
You understand what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hochma, your laws, apart from the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer present, your economy collapses faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad. even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somehow or you will be crushed.
I doubt that you see another option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out from you: due to the economic collapse impending on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies in itself, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
It will be necessary to organize and coordinate. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äî the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged in almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
You are very many, millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very high.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be in your place, too, afraid.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äî and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet ‚Äî and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äî and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äî and will only continue to grow, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, strategically and achieve that to become a reality.
We were on Friday in class, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be
That you perceive me as a press secretary

In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the Agency the participants of the event, Kherson managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now there arrived the equipment of the Russian Federation, "- said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, in the Donetsk region, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Vladimir Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title "Hero City."
February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, will stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the APU is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) Are people who have dragged on a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and maybe not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory... "
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we are not speaking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, no people. "

According to Ukrinform, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha, "the statement reads.
The DIU notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list here.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.

Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I expected with sadness is happening...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and did not doubt for a moment that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, in the Zhytomyr SBU, they gave me a copy of the shooting case of my great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-yard" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to doom the paedophile and breadwinner of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the criminal case, there is the surname of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
An apple from an apple tree not far, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio that doomed the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There is on Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal barrack," qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and there he quickly died.
KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
On top of the thousand-year Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed.
And then they made a brutal genetic experiment on what happened, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular pattern.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.

So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after the three heads of state, among whom was the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history. "
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The struggle must continue. "
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities blocked by it and allowing them to die from disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the executions in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have seen it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you nanich

Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of the Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the context of the war, now there is a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member countries - for the late delivery of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast "Fucking Questions" with the editor We are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.

I turned him down.
Then after a while he called that he had heart surgery.
I asked him just to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time we talked a lot.
I then began to have problems at work in parallel.

Such mutual assistance.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army has previously refrained. "
The Russians have launched missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babi Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, debris from a downed invader rocket crushed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenovka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, from which one person died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile attacks on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians planned to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgrade stated that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat the idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples that elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

The head of the President's Office, Andrei Ermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" on the weapons that our allies are transferring to us.
Ermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and seek to" bring down "the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is allegedly the destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
For the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are condemnable," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after being occupied for weeks.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything so that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who" ordered "this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another production of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia issued a statement announcing an "investigation" on charges of spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and telling Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head, "he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies like civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In all, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kyiv that until last week was controlled by Russian forces.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How occupants sneakily took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is one more point in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, Russian invaders have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave over to the Russian military training ground.
Ukrayinska Pravda found the Ukrainians and their relatives who were taken out to ask how the same "evacuation" was taking place and whether there were any ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text adhered to the voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like the true Plast members, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses did not take anyone.
At about 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people came into the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Who is there?" - I say that yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "Here Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bely (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took away the goods from there under the pretext "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can not do anything, because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought chickens to themselves, one tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and to the other - their white scotch tape and called it "opolchenko."
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktari.
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they gave us a "green corridor."
From the very beginning, we gave our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say that we do not want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grad or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the homeland - they say, "they will shoot you there, they will sell you to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burned out, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - Iskander worked in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "Yes, no, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the Chonki sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I'm crest, I'm with Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves get you.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, so be it. "
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
The sanatorium was not kept by force.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is generally not believed.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags now as there are Estonian ones. "
Maryna lived on the territory of the military town in Hostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center can not?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thank you for the agreement, moths are good

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the good news - the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, the headman of the village of Motyzhin, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were abducted on March 23, were killed and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On the sides of the highway, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes European Truth.
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done late.
Therefore, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes, "Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war, "he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

"I tell her that the" repair of the TV and radio "was delayed because of imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to say too much when they call."
"We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in Plyamka (cat - UP) on the belly and hind legs, the fur peeled off - it can be from stress, a change in feed and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears sirens and explosions. "
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polevaya took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was around - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her friend let slip, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always near the bed.
Mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She hears badly - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
The first thing I hid from her was a receiver and a TV.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments:)

I tell you, embassies have their backs here,
The Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Aideen Aislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislin who spoke with him
Literally twitter Eislin: "We received news from him:" 48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon. "
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Aislin allegedly speaks with his familiar American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they could not.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he left to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Bill 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere was... place for whom members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable - it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The same as before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others can take off - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and bill 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
But in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be fired.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom, discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
For starters, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has very limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also makes arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the very first word" war, "in 2021 they leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine," to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the invaders, will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan regions, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5. "
Details: According to the head of the regionVA, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There's a word-for-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. Made in another bank. Because you had to have an account to work with.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians of 27 and 28 years old involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radiyo Svaboda," human rights center "Viasna," the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the power support of SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured.
According to Viasna, during the arrest the men put up active resistance and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received on-site medical attention.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be harshly suppressed" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranavichy branch of BZhD and the administrator of thematic resources of BZhD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @ belzhd _ live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared extreme by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the railway transport and infrastructure facilities of Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring, in order to fight, manpower and equipment to Ukraine.
This is to raise self-esteem

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms, "the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
It would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

What day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs.
Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a news from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
The journalist of the TV channel "1 + 1" Natalia Nagorna released on the morning of April 12 a video that was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said "the bill goes to the clock."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade participating in the defense of Mariupol published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov, Andrei Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we are staying here
2 hours drive)) walking, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important thing
She forgot what she would do here.
The Czech drone squadron has started flights over Ukraine from today.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment is now left in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, they say: in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine, continue to work
All right. If everything goes well, I will agree
I will try myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady headman in the village in Jivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will rejoice and her mood will rise
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze on the street.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.

Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow should be warm.
But do not pity the destroyed houses, pity the people who are bullied by the invaders
In Kherson, the invaders mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was taken down.

Therefore, we already have great progress.
I'll definitely bring dumplings another time!
fashionable I do not have the strength to do them
Since I am repelled by the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after the guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it..
hello, I'm sorry that I didn't write off dinner for a long time and slept a little

If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we did not really want you to raise funds so that people would not think that we were speculating on this!
But for online filling, two points were not enough for me:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good, because the whole family will draw.

Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the specified brigade are recruited.
The enemy experiences a special problem when manning the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue to strike at objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th combined arms army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dolgenkoe and Dmitrovka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasnaya, Rubezhnoye, Nizhny and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Golden region, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolye, Trudolyubovka and Maryanskoye.
On the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automobile equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt
And how can you sleep want and I detain you
You definitely don't mind me coming?
maybe you just have no desire to see each other today, then tell me, I will understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, much less 1 + 1. We do not need to configure:)
I'm here to turn on the TV only to listen to the Czech language
I have today ends the package tariff for the month:)
Can we do it today on the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We only then with my father will meet, be sure to ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ
I read the ad on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in his own way, I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we are the things that you brought, but there are things that are small on us can you bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then next week I can start to go to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labour office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains:)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working on Teva
Friends are old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I have talked to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed about your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduza, Navalny's organization and a number of other places - have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except perhaps participation in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, perhaps, fell a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you owned freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up gripped by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the tsar's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think that he is safer. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and dutifully resigned yourself to plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for him or chose not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I then worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the children killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to make good money, some have gotten rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found better jobs.
Prices have risen, but is it a problem?
Moscow beamed festively and bald with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin transferred the post of president to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after several months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you massively protested.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground underfoot.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still do.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who fooled their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan - and never left.
They completely independently built a tent city and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
The police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly came from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding a new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbags, public wifai and hipster cafes.
Indeed, the Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself how on the streets of Homs state snipers calmly shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I kept silent - because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense. "
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Someone really speaks now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, as seems very likely, if he does not succeed, he will take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went to the protests and still took place in a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, remained not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority may be on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know where it's going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hokhma, your laws, aside from the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
Yet there remains one more.
Which in the end will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies by itself, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization has been crushed, but other, more informal, more decentralized structures can be created.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
The Moscow police can deal with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a damp cell under the police clubs.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically and make it a reality.

In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
According to the agency, the participants of the event, kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived at the site to disperse the equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This square is now, like the building, controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor in the Donetsk region.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, the Russian invaders kidnap the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelenskyy: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have pulled back a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, then we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something ‚Äì and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts became needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
of the Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to enter the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Everyone Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in bucha," the message says.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Massacres of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other again, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I removed children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment I had no doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-court" nobility, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had several cows was enough to doom the pahar and the breadwinner of young children to execution.
Relatives did not even find out about the burial place.
The grandmother said that nearly a hundred people were then taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was the KDBist informant.
An apple from an apple tree is not far away, as you know, falling...
The firing trio that doomed the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like the "Immortal Barracks" in Russia, which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and died quickly there.
KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
On top of the thousand-year Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then, on what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" of 1992, that's how it was.
Zo you saw my photos in a swimsuit

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the Boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.

I will ask whether Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonaszek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up the mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope so
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, at the stop 402 of the bus, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where reciprocity felt my heart.

I didn't go. Yes, she baked herself.  I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings at Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans have been seeing it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you on the night
We agree, agree for a tour, and write when to be collected

Serhii Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries - for the late supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to russia's position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Oath Questions", together with the editor of "European Pravda", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia,  may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I wondered if I really needed to look at it differently.
And he invited me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean for you?

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's quote: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of a downed rocket of the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles utterly destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of russia in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are thrown into a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and a time of despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

Are you doing well with imagination ??
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacations.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy the dress that you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain cannot perceive this.
It clings to the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now.... will agree... something will happen.
Mozog refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I don't have anyone and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. Everything that was we spent at home.
Many people are happy leaders in our jobs did not give wages.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for children ? Where should I live ?
You don't have the ability to take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... you go 1000 kilometres.

These are heroic leaders who go to the war zone without fear, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load a humanitarian into wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first-aid kits to the front.

There are a lot of people in Warsaw at the visa application center and the on-line queue does not work.

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (HEI of Ukraine) is a constituency that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located. [1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas Constituency is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national votes are held in the Foreign Constituency: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in higher education institutions are not held.

Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia was launching a "fake operation" on weapons that the allies were handing us over.
Yermak's quote: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "bring down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense system transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the Allies, and they are massively switching to the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively sends the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements followed reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depicted the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" on charges of Ukraine disseminating "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of alleged civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed from close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv." How the occupiers vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" takes place and whether there are ways to return to the Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, removed children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true Plast members, Denis and Marina packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke both not Russian and not Ukrainian came into the entrance.
They ask: "Who is there?" ‚Äì I say that yes. - "Come out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (who commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all equally Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want a war, ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, loot.
Chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äì their white tape and called it "militia".
In Ukraine, they arrived completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have what, artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They delivered 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktar.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so many thousands in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äì either with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland ‚Äì they say, "you will be shot there, they will be sold to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar", we passed an improvised control, many were completely undocumented, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible ‚Äì iskander worked in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I am a khokhol, I am from Chernigov.
But I believe that Putin with Lukashenko is not established, –ø–æ–∫–∞ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –≤–∞—à–∏—Ö –≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –Ω–µ dobe—å—é—Ç.
Bad people suffer!
And here Lukashenko is so good!
He said, so be it."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
In the sanatorium they did not keep it by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw ballistic missile launches across Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozyr said that Russians there were constantly shooting from training grounds.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was drafted.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their landfills are used to shell Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags now as Estonian flags."
Maryna lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center you will not be able to ?
Thank you, we always have everything.
Thanks for the arrangement, the bloodworms are good
And in this small apartment wifi does not catch, basically I answer all your questions and now I don't know how to be?And children have online classes from Monday, but there is no Internet.

Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were juveniles.
The headman of the village of Motyzhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were abducted on March 23, were found killed and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway, 20km from Kyiv, the bodies of several were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, then there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Pravda".
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked if Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all," he added.
To recap, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine a new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to blurt out too much when they call."
"For a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law the info about the war.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, Speck (cat ‚Äì UP) has fur peeled off on the belly and hind legs ‚Äì it can be from stress, changes in food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The speck, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was nearby were hidden from it ‚Äì formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always at the bedside.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She doesn't hear well ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have a cleaning of 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)

I'm telling you embassies are here,
A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC citing Eislin's family members and friends, Atlas News, citing the words of Eislin's friend who spoke to him
According to Eislin's tweet: "We received news from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the soldier's mother, En Wood, and she confirmed that her son said by phone that they planned to surrender.
Military friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone call, Eislin said of their unit's plans to surrender.
The brigade ran out of ammunition and food, he said.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall into the hands of so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also distributed on social networks, in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he left to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin was called Johnny by friends and relatives, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When you can bring things
Your tradition is very interesting, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the sphere of economy turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
One that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "soars" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off ‚Äì for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the start of the war and bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
People's deputy, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in UKROBORONPROM, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in UKROBORONPROM, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate one or another defense enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the very first word "war" leave Ukraine back in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
Firstly, it is a manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew for 2 days will be introduced.
Pavlyuk's quote: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew was strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the Regional State Administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a word-to-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. I did it at another bank. Because you had to have an account to work with.
Serbia's defence budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the predictions of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyo Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the forceful support of special forces "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to Viasna, during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical attention on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the Railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources of BZD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
To recap: The BYpol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the Peramog plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, the Russian Federation transfers through Belarus to fight, Ukraine manpower and equipment.
It is to raise self-esteem
Do you like to read books?
And on the phone, they also do not work on the Easter holidays?
Can the same be done by phone on any day or not?
Even a separate law was passed on this issue
We went here for 4 days, it's just a horror and not a road.

The United States bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector output includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step in the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they hold in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the passage is closed and I will approach you
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant at SkyUp, my mother was a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because we no longer have the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that for the first time someone will bring us) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it is affordable for us.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We do not have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such an easy time for us.

Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensa, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Natalia Nahorna, a journalist with the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social networks that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, for now we will stay here
2 driving hours )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
That's not an important matter

A squadron ofüá®üáø Czech drones has started flights over Ukraine sinceüá∫üá¶ today.
Nearly 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to the Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of the https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will keep their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything was fine. I love sweets, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.

But do not feel sorry for the destroyed houses, sorry for the people who are bullied by the invaders
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore off the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, perhaps something else needed to be given

How do I get credited the day that I wasn't at work there is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen are recruited from the specified brigade.
The enemy experiences a particular problem when manning the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the ORLAN-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Zolote area, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of some units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolya, Trudoliubovka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt it
And you as much as you can sleep want and I hold you
you definitely don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thanks. We didn't watch TV at home, much less 1+1. No need for us to set up :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to czech language
I am running out of a monthly rate package today :)
Can we do it by phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
My father and I will meet later, be sure to üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook ,then apparently Google wroteüèµÔ∏è something in its own way. , think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we took the things that you brought, but there are things that are small for us you can bring them in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then I can start going to work from next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if it gets there, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working at Teva
Friends are old and not so much, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I've talked to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what they Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later," Sasha replied succinctly as usual. ‚Äì Now, after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you ‚Äì those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äì how many of you have done at least something to resist this regime?
Except perhaps for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which have now probably placed a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to some extent ‚Äì messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year than 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overwhelmed by such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the back of the tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel that it's safer near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans from the Stasi did, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to lie down, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and dutifully accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
As he began to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum Kalah and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is that the trouble?
Moscow shone festively and glistened with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuriy Shchekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and terrified of what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.
A bit of outrage, a bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia blatantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin swapped places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was already too much, and you went to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you had not left the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan and never left it again.
They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, reinforcement and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbegs, public Waifai and hipster cafes.
In truth, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I myself saw state snipers shooting at my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for members of trade unions, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done so.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äì such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with Ukrainians ‚Äì or, which seems very likely, if he fails ‚Äì he will take it up for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely but mostly went out alone to protest and still served a short time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for an anecdote are not in such a distant past ‚Äì and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more so than in 2014 ‚Äì frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing on paper his superiority may be.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
Therefore, be on the alert.
You understand what everything is going to.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hohma, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains another one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äì the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized can be created.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand come out, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them into in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but are really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet ‚Äì and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a damp cell under police dubs.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only continue to intensify, becoming larger and larger.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be at home

In Kherson people went back to the rally, Russians did not manage to disperse

Zelensky: Mariupol ‚Äì the heart of war, stop fighting ‚Äì we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that fighting for the East of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of war ‚Äì and if the Armed Forces defeat there, Russians can leave negotiations and again occupy deoccupied territories.
Direct language: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It is fighting ‚Äì we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting ‚Äì we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city ‚Äì editor) ‚Äì people who pulled on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern state, in the (area) ECO, and if they are stronger, then the table of talks will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will do all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now deokuped.
They can go to it.
Then our situation in talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we say.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that you are difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose opportunities for diplomatic solutions if they are in us."
Direct language: "People will perceive peace in any case because people want this war to end.
On our terms, conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family lost something ‚Äì and I do not think they will satisfy any peace under any conditions.
But if we say not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."

Bubble is great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by news about animals of destruction from the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of rolled and shot people destroyed the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how could they happen in the 21st century?! How?!
Nothing surprised me at all. It happens exactly what I was waiting for...
I brought children and elderly parents from Kiev for the second day of war.
Then girls-college with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently assisted the Armed Forces and has not been doubted for a moment that in the event of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv my family will not be lucky.
Because I was and remained absolutely confident that the essence of the oppressed Communist-KDBest regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without a terror, it can not exist, it is built on a terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago in the Yetomir SBU gave a copy of the shooting affairs of the grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for the strat is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was unwritten, the guilt was denied.
Ethnic polish, Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-double" nobility, never walked in the cracks.
The fact that they lived on furs and had several measles was sufficient to admit the fucker and feeder of young children to destruction.
Parents did not even learn about the place of burial.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people took from the village then and killed all other than two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the karna case there is a surname of the pounding Share.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from the neighbouring village.
I believe in genetics and do not surprise if his relative was KDBest informator.
Apple from apple near, as you know, falls...
The shooting track, which was admitted to the stratu of peasants, was ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of grandfather, was interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources for "Bessmert barracks", which qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVDist found ways to punish and destroy almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin reprisals and publicly wrote the names of the killer ‚Äì the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
As if on the computer they found files with children's pornography, she was planted in prison, and there was already rapidly died.
KDBest and now kill those who are trying to learn the truth about the crime of the last century.
What suddenly do you surprise their actions now?!
There is concentrated the most fraudulent features of human nature.
On the surface of the millennium ordinary tradition slavery imperial chovenism of the 16-19th century.
And then, what happened, did animal genetic experiment, cutting the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
See the semi-French film "Checkest" of 1992, so everything was.
Zoo you saw my photo at the swimsuit
You can ask a wife what I can buy from cough.

So do you leave the city for a long time?
Seven years ago at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust "Babin Yar" in Kyiv, we honoured 80 years of mass shot by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the German President.
He spoke about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
This basis we must protect is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new clothes," he said, "that for us, Germans, can only be one answer: never more!
The fight should continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, famined by the famine of the inhabitants of its blocked cities and gives them death from the disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shots of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shots in Babyna Yar.
Over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Thus, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which has not long been impossible to imagine.
Germany detracts the delivery of heavy weapons required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose svastics.
This means combating all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that occur in Ukraine.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO ceased to be a far-reaching perspective
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO accession and only 18% of the respondents were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, Viktor Yanukovych escapes, annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbass war, the number of NATO enemies began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grow.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine‚Äôs accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens ‚Äì more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and NATO's assistance under the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance's account and country members - for the immediate supply of weapons, the refusal to close heaven, the unwillingness to save Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the podcast "Kate Question" together with the editor of the "European Truth" we talk about how Ukraine has helped the Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our perspective of NATO membership is close, as never in history and why security guarantees discussed in talks with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes in Kiev: they say "not previously done so"
Direct language Konashenko: "We are trying to sabotage and attack Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases last, the Russian armed forces will strike the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army was previously held."
Russians launched missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of the Russian missiles that were killed by the Ukrainian system of PPO fell on a multi-apartment house on the capital Poznyaky.
On February 26, the Russian missile hit a multi-storey at Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV on Drohozhichi near Babyny Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passengers.
On March 2, the Ukrainian PPO systems killed Russian missiles over the South Railway Station, flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defence building.
March 14, the fractions of the waged missiles of occupants split the house and trolleybuses in Kurinovka in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile invaded the residential array in Vinogradar, from which one person died, another 19 people were wounded, in particular four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital who evacuated from the city are still back in advance.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians can still attack Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and uninterrupted ammunition on the neighbourhoods of the capital.
The head of the Ministry of Defence Intelligence warned on April 12 that Russians plan to primarily a number of attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and to justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
April 1 near Belgorod in Russia exploded the oil base, allegedly due to the air attack of Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod stated that near the city allegedly fell "Ukrainian shell".
It is obvious that the elite in Washington, in Berlin, throws into cold go from the very opinion that Natov fighters will kill Russian bombers in heaven in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and society in general.
His speeches in parliaments and before multi-thousand crowds on the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he will convince the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, these are a sophisticated alloy of power, touching times of starting, gradually reach their goal.
While Baden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his co-citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against speeding up Ukraine's accession, this process is already under way.

The head of the Office of President Andriy Yermak reported that Russia starts a "fix operation" regarding the weapons that allies transmit to us.
The direct language of Jermaka: "They understand that they lose war, see their backwardness and seek to "beat" the supply of arms with any methods.
For example, one of the last fakes is a busy destruction transmitted by Slovakia ZRK S-300.
This information was already denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will be further? We know the Russian scripts. Name one of them.
They can launch a fiction that Ukrainian soldiers seem to be with weapons from allies, and it massively shifts to the army of the Russian army.
I want to warn such fixes immediately.
For the arms in the hands of the warriors of the Armed Forces only send the enemy to the world.

The international community continues to express shock and disturbance after the appearance of evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected this message as a "provocation".
‚ÄúNotes about the killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation,‚Äù said New Zealand Prime Minister Jassend Ardern to journalists in Willington on April 4.
‚ÄúRussia must answer the world for what they have done,‚Äù she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Caseda called the incident "violation of international law".
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and rescued in brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the district after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs on which allegedly depicted bodies of worshipped civilians with connected hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
President of France Emmaniel Macron declared in the radio on April 4, which is a sign that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
‚ÄúThis happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,‚Äù said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far that they made "genocides" in Bucha.
‚ÄúWe will do our utmost to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes are not punishable,‚Äù Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, the anniversary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Maria Zakharova rejected the accusation as "provocation".
She stated without proof that the United States and NATO "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
‚ÄúIn this case, I think, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubt about who ‚Äúordered‚Äù this story,‚Äù Zakharova said.
Previously, the Defense Ministry of Russia also stated without evidence that the image of Buche is "another placement of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia published a statement declaring "investigation" on charges of disseminating "knownly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of the ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in the city, and told the leaders of the Kremlin that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
‚ÄúI want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are executed,‚Äù Zelensky said in a video call, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For this murder, for this torture... for the shots in the bed," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
‚ÄúWhen we find people with hands connected to the back and headless, I do not understand,‚Äù he said about the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Buche, cities about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Freedom on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city of the body like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
Journalists of the AP saw at least 21 people in different places of Buche.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near the place, which, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
Similarly, victims were killed at close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the district of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "Kyiv is not." As occupiers under exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
This list contains another item, which is currently much less information ‚Äì exports of the local population to the enemy.
Approximately since mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements in their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military field.
"Ukrainian truth" found exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" itself takes place and whether there is a way to return after it to Ukraine.
Heroes of this text came to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and without evasion.
Fortunately, they live and maintain relationship with their natives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under strict force.
So in Melitopol the Russians stole the personnel of the second patient house, taken from there children without parents, among whom 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marin and their 10-year-old daughter Vale moved to Hostomil several months before the war.
Alexander himself received work at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plates, Denis and Marina gathered anxiety scales in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their car, and suburban buses had no more.
Approximately at the 12th hour of the 24th of February, they saw a helicopter with Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them involved in a nearby house.
Then the family descended into the basement and remained there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
Only 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the 6th evening, on February 24, people who spoke not in Russian, and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "It's who?" - I'm saying what's going on.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there was weapons.
All men asked whether they served in the army.
They said to women, "We have come to defend you according to Ramzan Kadyrov's instruction."
It was a Chechen UMON, not even troops, young guys for 25-35 years.
They said, "We helped the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bel (managed the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement Viking, fighting on the Chechen side in the first Russian-Czech war ‚Äì UP), now we will help you come."
On the third day they asked what we lacked.
We say that water, with it was a great problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the drive "all the same Russian will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the robbery of the store and say, "We understand that it is wrong, but we need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one especially wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says there: "You have 7 days to give our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from Russians.
They said, as well as that they came, because they didn't want, Ukrainians supported and at all good: "Putin is an outfit, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mainly they didn't fight, but they robbed the store, marodered.
Chickens brought themselves, one tied to one leg of the Georgian ribbon, and the other ‚Äì their white tape and called her "child".
They came to Ukraine at all unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were killed in Bucha, so they didn't even killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
Moreover, we had constructed units ‚Äì Chechens did not know each other, in the first days asked passwords to detect, their own or otherwise.
They were in us until March 13, then arrived by the Russian Armed Forces, and followed by them by the Omsk landlord.
They supplied 30-40 units of equipment between houses ‚Äì ours constantly entered it from "Baracters".
But this came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there are "Azov", and, in their words, "Azov" is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
Narativ "Kyiv has already seen" has been progressing since the beginning of March.
Sometimes Russians came to us ‚Äì either a landlord officer, or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì there was about Buch, Hostomel, thought, maybe we "green corridor" gave us.
From the very beginning we transferred our lists to Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we say, "You are exported to Belarus, and then perhaps to Rostov."
We say that we don't want to do it, not there.
What they said, "You will regret the psychology of your children!"
As it worked: they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äì either "Cradles" or mortars.
And then arrived back... Neighboring houses just burned, some of them fell.
In our house there was a direct impression on the third floor.
Later they agreed to bring us to Belarus only by promising to pass on to border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it was for betrayers of the homeland ‚Äì he said, "you are shot there, they will sell to the authorities."
We were lucky through Chernobyl, on both sides of the roads were bursts, broken techniques, although Belarus told that Russian equipment was immediately exported to them.
A lot of captains, digged equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian "Komar" crossing point, we have undergone improved control, many were undocumented because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, gave tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots the missile, and you can see the trace ‚Äì it worked "Escander" in Kiev.
Although this from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these aircraft fly, deploy on the border."
But we from the aviation, we have education, we understand that it is.
Then we were loaded to the bus and carried to the sanatorium "Chonk" near Gomel.
His head, Vinger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, saying, "I am here, I am with Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these are your horns.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He will say and be."
They offered an interview with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed in it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we so decided to leave, although they had a problem with documents ‚Äì the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian Consulate we did not help anything, but in Minsk at the train station said that no one will take anyone in the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium did not hold power.
Our second group migration representative said you can live for a maximum of a week and a half here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who voted to bring us to Warsaw.
Going near Mozyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw launching ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully shines, and then shines.
People sitting on a bus in Mozir told that the Russians were constantly shooting from the fields there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight completely.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she broke something son if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus where Minsk does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their fields are used to fire Ukraine.
Poland was waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we will be registered, decide what we will do further.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags now, certain, as much as Estonian."
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomil together with his brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able ‚Äì the house is no longer.
Nobody knew nothing about evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center will not be able to?
Thank you, we all have.And guests are always waiting for you!

On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk announced a joyful report ‚Äì the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupants threw away from all the Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should feel at this moment was blurred by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that only in Buche the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed simply on the street, some bonded their hands and shot in the bed, part of the murdered ‚Äì minors.
The murderers and traces of torture found the mayor of the village Motichyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and the son of Alexander, who were stolen on March 23.
Body Olga and Alexander were in a brotherly grave, Igor ‚Äì in sewerage.
Bondage routes for 20 km from Kyiv revealed the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in the blanket.
Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
"All equipment, all they already send, for some types of equipment this is done late.
So what, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what is now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries.
And some European leaders have changed the position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
On the question of this, Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in war, the President replied, "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, it would not be, or it would have a different look.
"It would otherwise deploy, we would have a shoulder of close neighbours, we could fight together.
But it's sure that he wouldn't do so," he added.
We remind the Prime Minister of Great Britain that Ukraine promised new military assistance, including armored equipment and anti-shipment weapons.

"This month we hide from the candle of the infusion about the war.
So far it is possible.
However, the flames (cat ‚Äì UP) on the bubble and rear paws raised fur ‚Äì this can be from stress, feed changes and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons to eliminate, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike the candlestick, is not deaf, hears both siren and explosion."
Due to the fact that Olga badly hears and spends most of the time in her room, her bride month lived in an apartment with her "inkogneto".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took weapons for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and what I advised was formally coming as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend talked, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened to 4 hours, then she sang 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time candlestick spends in its room.
He hears badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible for her.
If I heard the sound of her "hookers", she hid in her room.
First of all, she hid from her receiver and TV.
Then he called all those who communicate with her. It is 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk about anything, not about war.
I ask my girlfriend, she was there from the very beginning to the end

When you can bring things
You have a tradition very interesting, we go so on Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a legislative draft 7176, which is called "To monitor potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... the place at which members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.
Initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the Supervisory Board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new hazards to state companies, but is not yet aware of any company in which there was a need to physically meet the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law was understood ‚Äì it is a wonderful basis to "climb" all the achievements in the heavy reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory councils, and then establish manual management.
Those that were before 2015.
Why state companies supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans "fly" one harmful draft law, then tomorrow others can fly ‚Äì for example, it is possible to destroy the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of NBU.
Many can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was introduced to the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in a different way circulates among some people's defenders for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but in order to show possible consequences of the draft law, we will consider the arguments explained by the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals how to solve the issue of governance of state enterprises during the war.
Denis Kuden, First Deputy Minister of Economy, explained the need for such innovation to risks of Internet loss and other means of communication, which prevents remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the Supervisory Board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company can be paralysed.
Do we agree that such a risk is, however, will he be able to prevent the movement of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which become most of the entire composition) will supply their personal security higher for the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of quorum, the necessary supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, the new independent members of the Supervisory Board will not be appointed quickly, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
So proposed by the draft law 7176 decisions will probably not be able to preserve from the loss of the supervisory board the opportunity to make decisions, and more likely to lead to this!
People's deputy, the author of the draft law Dmitry Nataliukh provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "Multi enterprises, in particular the defence and industrial complex (ODC), now need a roll" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom".
First, there are almost no state enterprises in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the OPC.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the Director-General, who by the way will decide on the need for the placement of a enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the group.
In addition, this argument does not withstand the criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state enterprises of the OPC at all.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state companies and state banks, but let us try to understand some of them: "Convincing foreign experts with the first word "war", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with full salary of several hundred thousand UAH, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of the Supervisory Boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically arrived here.
Therefore, it says that they "leave Ukraine" softly, unjustly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long been resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is long common in world practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just electronic means help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from the supervisory councils, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporarily hiding in the family. With me 2 children.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of Kyiv regions, which were exempted from occupiers, will introduce a strengthened curfew for 2 days.

On the territory of these cities and villages the restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 6:00 on April 5".
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is categorically prohibited to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and foot.
Bags can go on the street only during anxiety signal to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of the Russian aggression ‚Äì clean and deplete the territory.
Omelanik called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
On the rest of Kyiv region the curfew will last every day from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a word translated into the word from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom added an explanation that is an incaso.
I already have an account. I did in another bank. Because I had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defence budget for several years in a row grew in geometric progress.
Overall, over the past six years Serbia invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, upgrading military equipment and acquisition of modern systems, raising 22 seats on the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries have seriously perceived the assumption of possible exacerbation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

According to "Vasny", while detaining, men performed an active resistance and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was wounded and stayed in a medical institution.
Another one was provided with medical assistance on the spot.
The Chief of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennadiy Kazakevich stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the RB will be strictly terminated" by the forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, a staff member of the Baranovic branch "BJD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BJD" in "VKontaktia and "Odnoklasniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in which he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 trainers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, announced by the Lukashenko regime as extremities, continues to call on Belarus to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "river guerrillas" thus try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus the Russian Federation throws to fight, to Ukraine live power and equipment.
It's to raise self-evaluation

I pushed something into the waterphone and connected two unnecessary shares for which money was removed and I can't disable them <unk>
and still removed money from the cards on which they were not
and I don't understand what money was withdrawn

USA prohibit investment in Russia and impose sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, introduce new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution of Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and prohibit US citizens from conducting business with them.
In addition, the state will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Baden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia to US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on decisions adopted by more than 600 transnational companies on withdrawal from Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms,‚Äù says the White House statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be published next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of minors Putin, wifes and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including with the expedition and Prime Minister of Russia Dmetry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions disable them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

Good evening, I can't share with you. There's a East of Mariupol for a son - live and in a building.
I advise to read Joe Dispense, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neural links
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published a video recording in the morning on April 12, which was handed over to the 36th marine infantry brigade from Mariupol.
The military say that they have not left weapons to participate in battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that "account goes for an hour".
Before that, on April 11, 36th separate marine infantry brigade, which participates in the defence of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could become the last fight for defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepsis that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the communication of the command with the defence forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defence operation should not be subject to public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers in the territory of the plant "Azovstal" in Mariupol to use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andriy Beletskyi, the Russian Army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which are held by policemen of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation and ourselves while remaining here

The squadron of the Czech Republic has started flights over Ukraine from today.
Almost 50 professional copters<unk> will serve to detect, and some of them - for the direct destruction of an enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "prayers" sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to Volodymyr Labutenko, the deputy of Mukachevo City Council.
Today, because their inter-mountain friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Stur delivered drones on appointment: they received special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective use of coppers - the place of their deployment is now secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic in the done stop are not planned, say: in the coming days to Ukraine will send a lot of interesting ‚Äúgifts‚Äù that will serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the occupants departed from the memorial "Slava Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopsk street.
Details: It is noted that unknown disruptions of the flag of the European Union have triggered the panels with photographs of Heavenly Hundreds and dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants destroyed the portrait of the characters of the Heavenly Hundred and the killed participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took the flag.

Headquarters: Russia is preparing provocations in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "in aggression against the neighbouring state".
It is not excluded from conducting provocative actions by the Russian Federation in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state.
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobozhanski direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupants will try to restore the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities in Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
Perhaps these weapons will be moved to temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also to restore the loss of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group composed of the 36th separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Borza, Zabakal region) 29 general military army of the Eastern Military District is recruited from the said brigade.
The special problem of the enemy is felt when the positions of drivers and driver mechanics are completed.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy to violate the supply of cargo to hostilities will continue to strike on transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine with a view to destroying them or withdrawing them from failure.
Definitive units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarus border in Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th general army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkiv, continue artillery shelling of individual districts of the city.
In the Isim direction, the air intelligence of the area continues to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses BPLA "Orlan-10".
The forces of up to two battalion tactical groups of enemies tried to offensive in the directions of settlements Dovgenka and Dmytrovka, success was not and went to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of settlements Popasna, Rube≈æna, Lower and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out an assault in the Golden area, he had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, occupants continue to act as an assault in the areas of the plant "Azovstal" and the seaport.
The forces of individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shelling positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysopil, Trudolibivka and Mariansky.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, four enemy attacks have been destroyed by defenders of Ukraine last day, five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to accomplish, but I doubt
And you can sleep and I'll detain you
You're not going to come?

We will meet with my father, surely
I read the announcement in the Facebook, probably Gugl wrote something in my writing<unk>Ô∏è. , I think phone numbers enough
Hello, we've got things you brought, but there are things that little one can bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director arranges, I can start working from next week because tomorrow to lunch I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if they get, because very big queues) and on Saturday rain :)
Looking for a brigade at the beginning, very liked at school chemistry, I learn Czech to perfectly know, dreams of working on Teva
Friends are not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now, too, hard times came to you.
During the last month I communicated with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned from the feet to the head, as well as every Ukrainian life.
Many of you run from Russia.
And many of you have acknowledged that they feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbours.
Because of why Ukraine is subjected to your name.
Some of you, activists, have long hanged the threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote Alexander Cherkassy, my very ancient friend from the Memorial.
Let's tell a little later, ‚Äì as usual, Sasha laconically replied. ‚Äì Now, after searching, we go on ruins.
Others ‚Äì artists, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let us be frank: except for a few of you ‚Äì those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medus, the Naval Organization and in a number of other places ‚Äì did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?
Besides participating in the rally when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Let's hide, late silence"
And if so, you are sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive participation, which are now probably a great burden on your heart?
So it wasn't always.
In the 1990s was a short period when you have to some extent freedom and democracy ‚Äì even a curve, but a real one.
But 1991 was not the best in 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, will you eventually cover such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the back of the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
How many people he did not kill, you still seem to be safer at him. Why?
Indeed, mistakes were admitted.
Instead of capturing the publication of the KDB archives, as the Germans have done with happiness, you have left the soul on the monument of Dzerzhinsky ‚Äì and allowed the KDB to lay down, update, reform and capture power over the country.
When you were put before choosing between the robbery of the country and the return of communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option ‚Äì and pokerly reconciled with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and it marked the end of mass protests for great social justice or against it in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Little of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you put on this eye.
I remember well those years.
I worked in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kal and other cities.
Sometimes in the weekend I returned to Moscow and fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful inhabitants, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we have already bored your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
I answered, "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, horror takes away, not my.
I'm just a foolish foreigner here.
This is your power to bomb one of your cities, kills your co-citizens."
But not, it was too difficult, too painful, and you did not want to know anything.
Then there was an economic rise in the middle of zero, due to the growing oil prices and Putin's readiness to watch through his fingers that part of the stolen money will remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you began to earn good, some rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices rose, are you wrong?
Moscow festively shined and foxed from the chic.
When several opponents ‚Äì Yuriy Shchekochin, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Litvinenko and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what happened.
However, the case did not go further.
When after two deadlines Putin transferred the post to President Medvedev, and the premiere itself took place, you, as I see, almost drew this attention.
When after a few months of the Medvedev government Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or destroyed it.
How many of you have met in the coming years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the suburbs of Kazbeg or in the cafe and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, until part of this country was occupied by your army?
I should recognize that we were unlikely to do much in the West if they did anything at all.
A bit of frustration, a bit of sanctions; but what is the importance that Russia is crucially violating international law, when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and sowed a presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was already too, and you were massively opposed.
The Name of Naval has become responsive, you did not go from the streets for a half year, and the regime eventually felt horror that losing the ground under the legs.
After that he striked in response.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind the game.
Some got huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I heard it so often and I hear so far.
"The state is so strong, and we are also weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Awakened by the pro-Russian president, who praised their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan ‚Äì and never left him.
They completely independently led the tent town and prepared for decisive defence.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend with fingers, reinforcements and cocktails of Molotov.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of flying, protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fleece became Yanukovych, and Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and to expel them if they badly do their business.
The maidan did not like Putin.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, using the general summits, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against, but there was little benefit from this.
And how many of you were delighted!
As I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
Somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who denied Putin and his shake suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to love him.
I'm hard to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mainly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hidden in books, cinemas, ICEA catalogue and parks as new after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 ‚Äì with their benbegs, a public bath and a hipster cafe.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so good ‚Äì and it becomes only better.
You almost drew attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor, who released my book about Syria, criticized it then in an interview, because I did not understand anything else in Syria.
Well, at least, I rided there and saw himself how the state snipers cold blood shoot in the streets of Homs in my children.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nemeller:
"They first came to socialists, but I declared ‚Äì because I am not socialist.
Then they came to the members of trade unions, but I declared ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came to Jews, but I declared ‚Äì for I am not a Jew.
Then they came to me, but no one else could say to my defence."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the majority declined.
Some really speak now ‚Äì such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most allows you to speak from abroad, some ‚Äì from the middle of the country like Marina Ovsannekova, risking to enter a new GULAG or make a company Navalnoe.
As for others, you are best known in which country you live.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin understands the Ukrainians ‚Äì or that seems to be very likely if he does not have it ‚Äì he will take for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone protested and still took place in a small term, but will soon get more serious.
Thousands of you who signed a petition who expressed disagreement in social networks (although even deprived of a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Time when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty was given simply for anecdotes, remained not in such a far past ‚Äì and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will remain?
Examples of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more than 2014 ‚Äì fall in love with Putin‚Äôs regime: they prove that they can fight with them.
And that the mind, motivation and courage can stop it, whatever its advantage was wicked on paper.
Due to everything, few in Russia this realizes, as well as what is generally going on war.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with which you maintain communication.
And Putin knows you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what everything goes to.
Beautiful life in exchange for your silence has reached the end.
Your choice is just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account repressive ones, worth not more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media no longer, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket for aircraft abroad, even if some flights remain.
Now Putin will not satisfy your silence, he will require your consent, your pokerness.
And if you do not give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or disappoint you.
I doubt you see another option.
And yet it remains another.
How to finally break this regime.
And perhaps in conditions that have emerged, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark does not burn from you: due to the economic collapse imposed on Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly, and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace to go on the street.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the meeting itself, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äì the Internet that mode can limit, but how still works and how you can set up in almost any circumstances.
The Naval Organization was destroyed, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're a million.
Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand goes, it will be stunned.
Will you have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to work?
After all, why did he force them in Ukraine, all because he forced them to pass?
Of course, the danger will be very big.
Many of you will feel fearful; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would also be afraid of your place.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who prefer to neglect their owner, who prefers not only to demand freedom, but also really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the life of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will destroy the joke in the chat of the computer game ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will destroy the internet ‚Äì and will be arrested; your close friend will assume mistakes ‚Äì and will die in the raw chamber under the police duplicates.
That's what has happened for many years ‚Äì and will only be further strengthened, acquiring more and more scales.

In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse them
As the participants of the event told the agency, the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived on the scene to disperse them.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protest actions on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, and there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson with the special title "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of the enemy to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in (the region of) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to a return even to those cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelenskyi also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if we have them."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace either way because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for life.
You cannot fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of servicemen of 64 separate motorized rifle brigades who directly participate in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the message reads.
In GUR MOU, they note that all war criminals will appear before the court and be prosecuted for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from the Russian invaders.

place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! As?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted for a moment that my family would not be spared in the event of an occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It simply cannot exist without terror, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU had a copy of the great-grandfather's shooting case removed: the whole case is more than a hundred pages long, but the death sentence is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, he had five children, he was from free people, a poor "one-court" nobility, he had never been a serf.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to sentence the plowman and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even learn about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, the knocker's surname is Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
As you know, the apple does not fall far from the apple tree...
The firing squad that sentenced the villagers to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (no sarcasm) informational resources in Russia, such as "Bessmertny barak", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited by the system and then destroyed.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, he was put in prison for it, and he quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most despicable features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed on the thousand-year-old Horde tradition.
And then on what came out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask my wife what I can buy for a cough?
I'm sorry because I don't have anyone to ask

We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big but that men live here who drink alcohol and smoke indoors, loud music is the least that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and children... it's scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with housing, for money, please.
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the rooms is such that they are smoking right here.
I'm begging you, one of them is barely standing, he's shouting something, he doesn't like something. Very scary.
I'm just asking if you can help üôèüèº

I forgot to write you, sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
They asked me to convey my congratulations and to say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, which they have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
It suits me especially on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter services.

So, so far, Nestor only has a runny nose, and in Halinky, the temperature is 37.7, dinner is 38
The queue for General Chapek there is very slow.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that the love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She thanked me very much, she even cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
There were tears in her eyes.
She said that if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions to God, why there were situations in my life that just made me despair in everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the meeting
This is true, but we have not yet orientated ourselves in the area and do not know where everything is. Today we looked for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two large ones
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to communicate in Russian or someone else in the family?
It is possible for children to come to Vali and play in the hall
Well, let's take a risk then :)
I am also glad to have met you
For housing, I talked to Volodymyr and consulted whether to wait for me until they found it or to look for it myself. The ladies who live with us also told us that we should go to the museum metro station. There is an institution there that helps us find housing.
For the sake of the little one, I will cross the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't even know the answers to some of their questions
That would be good for Thursday, if possible
I can't call the doctor because I haven't taken the food license test yet.
But I can't call him because my account has run out of money.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and I can't top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodaphone application, I cannot change the tariff so that I have normal calls and Internet, or top up the number.
I'm already going crazy
Where the price is not the cheeks, but the face... The title does not sound right, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without work
I just wrote that I'm in class at school
Sorry to bother you, I was just really worried
But it is already closer to the time they leave the borders of Ukraine to know exactly what they will reach.
Because now everyone's life is in question.
So. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not match. Everything must be measured
I am looking for everything for the home and for the children.
Thanks to the people who accepted me, I live in a chapel, they always ask if I need something, and I am ashamed to say, I ask to find it myself.
I just came home, I'm having breakfast now :)
Don't explain anything, please pretend I'm not there
impossible to answer without resume sent
I won't be able to tell my mother that :)
And I'm actually a bit uncomfortable now that I couldn't hold back my feelings before we left the apartment....Like last night....

I turned to Caritas, they offered temporary housing for a week - two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why are there fewer and fewer
The flowers are blooming. Everything is fine. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As "European Truth" reports, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the Boxer armored personnel carrier version for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is it us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish the account and let's go. I will write you back. thank you

Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up the math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope for that
And so she is very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect the Internet to my Czech number
Yesterday at bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine with whom my heart felt reciprocity.

So you are leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the German president.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!"
The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities blocked by it and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, agree on an excursion, and write when to be collected

Serhii Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbas war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in wartime conditions, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the "Damn Questions" podcast, together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about exactly how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is close , than ever before in history and why the security guarantees being negotiated in the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my volt partner, it is marked that my application is pending.
I submitted it through this mobile application

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After some time he came back again and asked for my forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him just to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During this time we talked a lot.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?

I perfectly understand the price of unskilled labor and I understand that I will not be able to have the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv, and the money that I earned at home, I will not receive here either.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all kinds of bad thoughts creep into my head, so I have to occupy myself with some kind of physical activity

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "they have never done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see sabotage attempts and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, then the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at the decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army previously refrained from doing."
The Russians launched missile attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupation forces of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, remnants of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in Poznyaki, the capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower in Dorohozhychy near Babyny Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed missile of the occupiers crushed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vynogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vynogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people died.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that it is still too early for residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and besides, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian projectile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky does not speak so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated blend of power, poignancy and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, that's why we don't want to be considered scammers.

Are you doing well with your imagination??
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't handle it.
He clings to the old reality.
You call work to find out whether you should go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last long.
Now ... they will agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many people were not paid by our managers at our jobs.
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You cannot take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you have 1000 kilometers to go.
You don't know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what's next? It is unknown. How much? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And of every iron - we don't have one.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here

These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who, under fire, remove garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the essentials.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining, and in their free time they also volunteer, collecting first-aid kits for the front.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding weapons that are being transferred to us by allies.
Yermak's direct speech: "They understand that they will lose the war, they see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems handed over by Slovakia.
Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already denied this information.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and they are massively transferred to the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn against such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces had committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously injured by Russian troops are deplorable," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after weeks of occupation.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, have shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian forces have committed "war crimes" in Buch.
"What happened in Buch calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro S√°nchez, said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She claimed, without evidence, that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated, without evidence, that the image of Buchi was "another staging by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Buch.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement in which it announced an "investigation" into accusations that Ukraine spread "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke out on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchi to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should bear responsibility for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims strewn on the streets of Buchi, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were strewn on the ground near what local residents said was used as a base by Russian forces.
It appears that the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kyiv that was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is gone." How the occupiers despicably deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is one more item in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to a Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Pravda" sought out the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text insisted on voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the fallen Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepinskyi.
The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr got a job at Antonov Airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, even though it was a civilian.
As true sleuths, Denys and Marina packed their emergency suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At approximately 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 o'clock in the evening on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say yes. - "Get out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there were any weapons.
All men were asked whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Belyy (commander of the unit of the nationalist UNA-UNSO "Viking" movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext that "the Russians will take them anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So, after looting the store, they brought sausage and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, so is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought in chickens, tied a St. George's ribbon to one leg, and their white scotch tape to the other, and called her "militia".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Buchi, so that they didn't even take the killed, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had united squads - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They placed 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that the ZSU no longer exists, but there is Azov, and, according to them, there are 100,000 Azovs in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either an airborne officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was talk about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You will be taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then take pity on the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our building had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland - they said, "you will be shot there, sold for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear shots! A rocket fires, and a trace is visible - it was "Iskander" operating in Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the "Chonky" sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are finished.
Poor people are suffering!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
As he says, so it will be."
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "But you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men can't go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
They did not help us at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk at the train station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were helped a lot by Belarusian volunteers.
We were accommodated in Minsk and escorted.
In the sanatorium, they were not held by force.
The migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a week or a half at most, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly shooting from firing ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals resign from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, they do not believe at all.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, we are deciding what to do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian flags."
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Gostomel together with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you be somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as a guest!
Thanks for the arrangement, the moths are beautiful
And in this small apartment there is no Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions, but now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes since Monday, but there is no Internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
It is written in the Koran: "even a leaf from a tree falls with his knowledge."
Our children study online, I am a salesman and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, Maryana is a handyman.
Can you agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the good news - the Ukrainian military liberated the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that should have been felt by Ukrainians at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that the Russians shot at least 280 civilians in Buchi alone.
They were killed just on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in blankets were found on both sides of the highway 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.

The charitable organization Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.

Good afternoon, I'm talking to you in my thoughts - I have to learn Czech, and I can't tear myself away from the news.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, "European Truth" writes.
"All the equipment, everything they're already sending, for some types of equipment it's late.
Because when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have taken a different form.
"It would unfold in a different way, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all," he added.
It will be recalled that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can return home

Why do people run away?
Why don't they live in a territory where there is no war??
Are you in your right mind??
Did you live in a warring state?

When the majority of enterprises DO NOT WORK.
When there is nowhere to earn.
When do children hear anti-aircraft fire?
Did you live like this?

If Mrs. Krzhkovska has not come yet, wait for her a moment, she said that she has a meeting before that, so maybe she will be a little late, but she knows about you, she booked you at this 9 o'clock precisely so that you made it to the doctor.

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio receiver" has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to talk too much when they call."
"We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it works.
However, Plyamka (the cat - UP) had fur on her belly and hind legs - this could be due to stress, a change in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Spot, unlike her mother-in-law, is not deaf, she hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva picked up a weapon for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was nearby - she formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always by the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
Hard of hearing - this allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. These are 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything but the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaned :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)

I'm telling you, there are only embassies here,
A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a Briton who served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Aislin who spoke to him
Aislin's twitter verbatim: "We received word from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is participating in the Mariupol defense operation.
BBC reporters contacted the soldier's mother, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Aislin told them about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called "kadyrovtsy" units without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also circulated on social networks, in which Aislin is allegedly talking to an American friend of hers who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they did not succeed.
Earlier, the British man said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Aislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took the oath.
Aislin was called Johnny by his friends and relatives, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

I will ask my husband in the morning if he will make it tomorrow.
When you get home, write to me please, I would need to talk to Daniil.
The Bolshevik attackers fully recovered for their losses in the battle.
They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his relative whose name is unknown, the young man Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep sinkhole, which was covered with earth."
According to memories, "there was a kind of dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents would run from house to house in a rush.
Bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets
And maybe I really will follow you. I need you. I can not without you.
3. Which of your own activities/activities would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

I wish I could thank everyone who helped us, because it was the last hope, really.
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can you bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "Regarding the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we are not aware of any company that has had the need to physically hold supervisory board meetings at its location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The one that existed until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law "takes flight" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take flight as well - for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be demolished.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in one way or another has been circulating among some people's elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments used to explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will present our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make the remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be possible to prevent it by moving the members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's deputy, author of the draft law, Dmytro Natalukha, provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPK), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
There is a supervisory board only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the necessity of relocation of one or another defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmytro also presents arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of the work of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first word "war" will leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
First of all, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also not be forgotten that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people also have other occupations, and electronic means of communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just another convenient opportunity.
Welcome. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter with a family. I have 2 children with me.

In the Brovarsky, Vyshhorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the Oblast, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of populated areas and in other public places, to travel by vehicle or on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territories.
Omelanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. every day.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Good afternoon, you have a toy box
I traveled around the city a lot by transport, by car.
However, I'm not good at navigating names.
This is in principle normal, because my thoughts were about something else entirely.
Currently, I am psychologically calmer compared to when I first arrived here
How are you ?
Fake information about conscripted students, preparations for the evacuation of higher education institutions and freeing up places in student dormitories was spread on social networks.

I understand that you, as a volunteer and just a good person, sincerely want to help and support us.
And I understand that you need a photo, that you are helping and so on...
But understand me too. I lived well in Ukraine, I did not need any help.
And I don't want some of my friends to see it and so on. Understand me correctly too ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
Can I ask a question?
Do you know how life turned out for those girls who left you?

I wanted to ask for a long time and I forget everything.
And how are you doing with the vaccination against COVID?
I did not have time to make a booster (third dose) of the vaccine at home. Is this vaccination paid here?
I will wait when you call. Something to take with you from the devices?
It's good that you have already arrived üôèüèª And I am very grateful to you for a pleasant evening and üåπ

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osypovychy, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Vyasna", chief of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, with the force support of "SOBR" special forces.
According to "Vyasna", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were treated at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovytskyi branch of "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "BZD" in "VKontaktie" and "Odnoklasnyky" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
We will remind: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers manpower and equipment to Ukraine in order to fight.
This is to raise self-esteem

The USA bans investments in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's daughters, the largest Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions would freeze any of their assets that touch the US financial system and bar US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the US was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit US citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day, Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze any assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the road is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we didn't even think that we would be forced to flee, because we no longer had the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that someone will take us in for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but only if we can afford it.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We have no bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lecture, and after that I went to work in the children's room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood everything and will do everything well.

On what day does the colleague want to clean the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your business
Good evening, I cannot but share with you. There is news from Mariupol that his son is alive and in the army.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections
On the morning of April 12, the journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Nataliya Nagorna released a video recording that was given to her by the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours".
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, assured that there is a link between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky reported, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, for now we stay here
2 hours of driving )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she was going to do here
A squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones started flying over Ukraine üá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will be used for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers of the "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Volodymyr Labutenko, a deputy of the Mukachevo City Council.
Today, their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones as intended: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use the copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will keep their location a secret for now.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them
I'm worried we won't make it. A lot of luggage.
I will return to Ukraine soon, continue to work
Fine. If everything is okay, I will agree
I will try myself, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were in person with the old woman in the village in Jivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze outside.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical abilities üòä
mom and dad must be obeyed
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and raining here. It should be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity about the destroyed houses, it's a pity about the people who are mocked by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, gutted panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was taken down.
Good morning, thank you children for the Christmas carol, we don't have such a custom, that's why we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else should have been given
There is someone to talk to in Czech, if anything.

Therefore, we have already made great progress.

Since I am pushed back from the days and times when there is work to clean the apartments after guests, I can roughly say the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you have anything to say about it..

If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to fundraise so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But two points were not enough for me to fill in online:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. good night

Staff briefing: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansk direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, the specified weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the personnel losses of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal region) of the 29th combined arms army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen from the said brigade are being recruited.
The enemy feels a special problem when filling the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway with the aim of identifying the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the Zolote area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Visokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it
And you, how can you want to sleep and I'm keeping you
are you sure you don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to configure :)
I will turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package ends today :)
Can we do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery

Good afternoon, we took the things you brought, but there are things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week, because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it works out, because the queues are very long) and it will rain on Saturday :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am studying the Czech language in order to be fluent, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I have been in contact with many of you over the past month.
Your life, which was never easy anyway, turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", at "Novaya Gazeta", at "Echo of Moscow", at "Meduza", Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - how many of did you do at least something to oppose this regime?
Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the Russian journalist's column "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why so?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, dammit, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to let some of the stolen money stay in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.
A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some received huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I heard it so often and still do.
"The state is so strong, but we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.
They built a tent city all by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Out of nowhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.
The rest of my remaining friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as if new after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You just turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or something... Even the editor in Moscow, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I didn't seem to understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs government snipers shoot my children's peers in cold blood.
Among all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or making company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed - he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far met with a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so far gone - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.
In spite of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You understand what it's all about.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go some way or get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And perhaps, under the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.
If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would also be afraid if I were you.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, many lives will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a dank cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Keep your cool, think strategically and make it happen.
We went to class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
We will be home in the evening

Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and arrange them in that room with clothes, and yesterday Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her until 7:00 p.m.

In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the Agency the participants of the event, the Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This area is now, like the building, controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against protesters and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military use force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson with the special title "Hero City."
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, will cease to fight - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) - people who pulled away a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we ascertain.
We believe in our result, in our victory.... "
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I do not think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people. "

According to Ukrinform, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!

Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. What is happening is what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took the children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and I remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to remove a copy from the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-yard" nobility, never in serfs did not go.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the pahara and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the surname of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
Apple from the apple tree near, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio, doomed to the execution of peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal Barrack," qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that on the computer found files with child pornography, for her put in prison, and there quickly died.
KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then over what happened, made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
So you saw my photos in the swimsuit

Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as a Fpoint employee, the first question was how the dog was found, how the pug was found.
Everyone is following the Facebook page.
Asked to send you greetings and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about the people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if a child comes and parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.

The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I do not know how in Europe, but in our country people marry for various reasons, mostly selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I do not love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took home and took my aunt away at once.
She was very grateful, she was crying.

Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there would still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if it will. I am also very grateful to you.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had a lot of questions to ask God why there are situations in my life that just made me despair of everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a meeting
This is so, but we are not yet oriented in the area and do not know where everything is. Today, the supermarket was looking for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so two and need a large size

According to "European Pravda," writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the version of the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to be matched relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?

I will ask whether Hryhoriy Denysenko or maybe Yonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I and them can be something useful?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for it very much

I did not go. Yes, I baked myself. This I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history. "
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, the Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must continue. "
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities blocked by it and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides during the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Damn Questions," together with the editor of "European Truth," we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in the negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.

After a while he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.

During this time, we talked a lot.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.

Russian Army Threatens to Launch Missile Strikes on Kyiv: They Say "They Haven't Done This Before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army had previously refrained. "
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, on the outskirts of the capital there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a number of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that near the city allegedly fell "Ukrainian shell."
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is strongly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" on weapons handed over to us by the allies.
Direct speech of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to" knock down "the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 SAMs transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the world.

The international community continues to express shock and resentment after evidence emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed the reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must respond to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who" ordered "this story," - said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another statement of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee issued a statement announcing an "investigation" into Ukraine's "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," Zelensky said in a video message, moving from the Ukrainian language to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head, "he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near the site, which locals say was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupiers viciously took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list, there is another item, which is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to the enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" has found exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Yosyp Zachepynsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true Plast members, Denys and Maryna collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own cars, and suburban buses did not take anyone anymore.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke both non-Russian and non-Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They asked: "Who is there?" - I said yes. - "Come out!."
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looting.
Chickens brought himself, one tied to one leg St. George ribbon, and the other - his white Scotch tape and called it "Opolchenka".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to reveal their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, and behind them - the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - our constantly got into it from the "Bayraktars".
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been moving since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor."
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say that we do not want either there or there.
To which they answered: "Pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and began to shoot from under the house - or "Grad", or mortars.
And then came back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit in the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - they say, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that Russian equipment was immediately taken to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear the shots! The rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around on the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.
His head, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here, I am a hohol, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they reach your goal.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, it will be so. "
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called so) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian Consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one in the bus will not take.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr, said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from landfills.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe.
They say, "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we pass the registration, decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, perhaps, as many as Estonian ones. "
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not - the house is no longer there.
Nobody really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center can not?
Thank you, we have it all. And we are always waiting for you!
Thanks for the arrangement, the hoes are good
And in this small apartment does not catch vayfay, basically all your questions I answer and now I do not know how to be? And children from Monday classes online, and there is no Internet.

On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk reported the joyful news - on March 31, the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the dead - minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the elder of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Ihor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On both sides of the road 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth."
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
Because when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100% support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes, "Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no such war, or it would look different.
"It would unfold differently, we would have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war, "he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

When prices soared by 100-200%.
When most businesses DO NOT WORK.
When there is no place to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like that?
You have no idea.
And God forbid not to have.
If you also find out - it will be HORROR.
So we run away.
Some of us are confused, with phones... left over from our other lives... yes, some have not adapted in a month.
And you could adapt from 0 per month.
Yes, the state provides us with 5000 CZK.
Would you be able to live on these funds?
Many funds give food.
Have you tried to ride on the subway, with children in funds?
When in one you are looking for food, in other clothes, and to go to the 3rd is not enough time.
And tomorrow to go again... because the food that was given is enough only for a day.
You WANT to provide for yourself... and children where??
How to live without knowing the language?
When you can't even ask for help.
Yes - there are free courses... but what to choose?
Search for work, food, clothes, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my children cannot be there.
Just - understand us.

"I tell her that the" repair of the TV and radio "was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned so as not to let go of excess when they call."
"For a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law the info about the war.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in the Stain (cat - UP) on the belly and hind legs skinned fur - it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The stain, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions. "
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polyova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was near - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hears badly - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I was hiding in my room.
First of all, she hid her receiver and TV.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. These are 6-7 people.
Asked to talk to her about anything, not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments:)

The Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Eidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke with him
We received news from him: "It took 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon. "
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Journalists of the air force contacted the mother of the soldier Ann wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brenan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about the plans of their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrov" units.
Also in social networks, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed, in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his friend an American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried in civilian clothes to get out of the city, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere was... the place for which the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making of the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - this is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law takes off under patriotic slogans, then others may take off tomorrow - for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to it!
MP, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the draft law 7176 does not introduce any changes in the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first word" war "leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine," to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, they will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavliuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5. "
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean up and mine the territory.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6: 00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyj Swaboda," human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the strong support of the "SOBR" special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Viasna", during the arrest, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of "BZHD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "BZHD" in "VKontaktie and" Odnoklassniki "Valentyn Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports @ belzhd _ live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the railway transport and infrastructure facilities of Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "rack partisans" thus try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring manpower and equipment to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector output includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms, "the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from carrying out transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blockade of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for the son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dyspenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1 + 1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which she received from the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of "Azov" Andrey Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the soldiers of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good

The squadron of Czech drones has started flights over Ukraine since today.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https: / / www.facebook.com / examplehere101 / Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

Today it was cooler and rain. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But it is not a pity for destroyed houses, it is a pity for people who are being bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore the flag of the European Union, destroyed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They demolished the flag.

Summary of staff: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Trans-Dniester region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Trans-Dniester region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobozhansk direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, the recruitment of servicemen from the said brigade is carried out.
The enemy feels a special problem when recruiting positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue attacks on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10."
By forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.

I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Friends are old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilt and shame because of the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is subjected on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization and a number of other places - did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?
Except that participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you to some extent owned freedom and democracy - messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year for 1917.
Why, whenever you finally have a revolution, do you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer near him. Why is it so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, refresh, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option - and humbly resigned to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to equalize Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I then worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and with my own eyes saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but isn't it a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone from the chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the case did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or fell silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much if we did anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a bit of sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to the protests.
The name of Navalny became callous, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once captured the Maidan - and never left it.
They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit to it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shayka suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding new things in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which was started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbegs, public vaifay and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it becomes only better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-blooded shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I was silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I was silent because I am not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense. "
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
The majority allows themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new gulag or make a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin will deal with the Ukrainians - or that it seems very likely that if he does not succeed - he will take up you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone went to the protests and still held a short time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, were not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority is on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what everything is going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights still remain.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which in the end will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out of you: because of the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small cities.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies in itself, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was defeated, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300 thousand, it will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them into Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I would be in your place too afraid.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really tries to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a chat computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only continue to intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home

In Kherson, people again came to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the agency the participants of the event, Kherson managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now there arrived the technique of the Russian Federation", - said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, residents traditionally gathered for protests on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
February 24, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop beating ‚Äì we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the de-occupied territories.
"Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have a weaker position.
They (the defenders of the city ‚Äì ed.) ‚Äì people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Sadly, we are concluding.
We believe in our results, in our victory.
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "We must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have one."
People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we are not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there's no people.

The dining room needs a code
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in the city of Kyiv. Bucha Kiev region.
As Ukrinform reports, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Kyiv. "Bucha," the message reads.
In the GUR MOU note that for the crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated towns and villages, mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have the money for two months of rent, in the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. This is exactly what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole matter is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-yard" nobility, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was enough to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children to death.
The relatives did not know the place of the funeral.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and wouldn't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB whistleblower .
The apple does not fall far from the tree, as you know...
The firing squad that doomed the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal barrack", qualitatively reminding of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers ‚Äì the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
As if on the computer found files with child pornography, for her put in jail, and there quickly died.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you surprised by their actions now!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Over the millennial Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were superimposed.
And then over what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of the red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
Aww did you see my pics in the swimsuit

Yesterday all went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as a Fpoint employee, the first question was how the dog was found, how the pug was found.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
We asked you to say hello and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, what privileges they have in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.

As reported by "European truth", writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the Ministry of economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be held in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered in 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?

This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.

So she wasn't scared that no one came
I didn't go. Yes, she baked. I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you going out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the privilege to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.
If the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes, then for us Germans there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month, Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" is not just about opposing the swastika.
This means to fight with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "The Bloody Questions", together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain. Why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever before in history and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here

I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then a short time later he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
Then I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.

Therefore, God himself decided our fate.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "before not done this"
Konashenkov's direct speech: We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozniaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower in Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, debris of a downed missile destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinohradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition on the outskirts of the capital a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a number of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda stated that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the town.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky is not speaking so much to them as to their voters and society in general.
With his speeches in parliament and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of power, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is strongly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as a crook.

He is clinging to the old reality.
You call to work, find out - go out today to work or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something is clear.
There is hope... It's not for long.
Now....agree...something will happen .
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I don't have anybody anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many of our top executives in our jobs have not been paid a living wage .
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... You're going to go 1,000 miles.
You don't know if you'll have them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next? Unknown. How much is it? Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.

We have a choice to stay there and put children in danger or try to escape here

Head of the President's Office Andrey Yermak said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" on weapons that are being handed over to us by allies.
"They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is allegedly the destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can run fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to warn you of such fake news.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the incidents as a "breach of international law".
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops. who left the area after being occupied for several weeks.
Photos purportedly showing the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were indications that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
Russia's Investigative Committee issued a statement on April 4 announcing an "investigation" into allegations that Ukraine had spread "deliberately false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... "Shot in the back of the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of alleged civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a site that locals said was being used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appeared to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, we have everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupants sneakily exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is much less information now ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Around mid-March, the Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainska Pravda" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is going and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was a civilian.
As true scouts, Denys and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone.
At about 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor's house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "Who is?" ‚Äì I say yes. "Out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen riot police, not even the troops, young men aged 25-35.
They said, "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi. (He commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war ‚Äì UP) Now we are here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, she had a big problem.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they after the looting of the store brought sausages and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They have always separated themselves from the Russians.
They said that it was good that they came, because they did not want the war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, and went to loot shops, looted.
Chickens brought themselves, one tied to one leg of the St. George ribbon, and the other ‚Äì his white tape and called it "popolchenko".
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked ... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords in order to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, and after them ‚Äì the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly got into it from the "Bayraktars".
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no more, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been pushing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an officer of the landing, or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they responded, "So pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started firing from under the house ‚Äì either with Grad or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not leave, saying that it was for traitors of the motherland ‚Äì they say, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, they gave us tea.
And here we hear gunshots! The missile is firing, and the trace is visible ‚Äì it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Monks" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came and said: "Vot, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stay until they finish your votes.
Poor people are suffering!
Lukaku is so good !
As you say, so be it.
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one will take a bus.
We were very helpful to the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
In the sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, beautifully glows, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly firing from the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their ranges are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, we had friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through the registration, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, probably, as much as Estonian ones.
Marina lived on the territory of the military camp in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you be in the middle on Monday?

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some of them were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
The village head of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor ‚Äì in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth".
"All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have been different, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that the war would not have happened, - he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

I hear a lot - the war on 10% of Ukraine's territories.
Why do people run away?
Why not live in a country where there is no war?
Are you in your mind??
Did you live in a war-torn country?
When the prices soared by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises do not work.
When there is nowhere to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like that?
You have no idea.
God forbid they have.
If you find out, it will be horrible.
That's why we're running away.
Some of us are confused, with phones... What's left of my other life... Yes, some have not adapted in a month.
And you would be able to adapt from 0 in a month.
Yes, the state gives us 5000 kronor.
Would you be able to live on that money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you tried riding the subway with your kids in the funds?
When one is looking for food in the other clothes, and to go to the 3rd is not enough time.
Going again tomorrow... because the food that was given is only enough for a day.
You want to take care of yourself... Where are the kids??
How to live without knowing the language?
When you can't even ask for help.
Yes - there are free courses ... But what to choose?
Looking for work, food, clothes, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my kids can't be there.
Simply - understand us.
You come to the town hall, and at the bottom of the reception you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovskaya, if you do not show the way and the door number to her.
It will be written on his door, there is the head of the department.
If you can't agree, call Dominic, but I believe that everything will go smoothly.
If Ms. Krzkowska doesn't come yet, wait a minute, she said she had a meeting before, then maybe she'll delay a little, but she knows about you, ordered you for this 9th hour just so you could get to the doctor.
Yes, of course, it would be very nice to spend time together

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio" was delayed because of imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to boo when they call."
"We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it is succeeding.
However, Spot (cat ‚Äì UP) has fur on the belly and hind legs ‚Äì it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid the war from her, and the fact that I was near her ‚Äì I formally came for a few hours as usual.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hearing badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who talked to her. That's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk about anything but war.
I'll ask my girlfriend she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaning :)
Hello, I hadn't thought of that :)
Hello,if you need more help tomorrow we will be able to come

I'm telling you the embassies are the backstops here,
The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British soldier, who is a member of the Ukrainian marine brigade, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family, that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Aydin Aislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC, citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News cited Aislin's friend who spoke to him
Aislin's tweet read: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything we could to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We had no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon.
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call Aislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of the Atlas News publication contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender to the Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrov's" units.
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of the phone conversation, which allegedly Aislin speaks with his friend American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
Aislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
Very interesting tradition you have, we go so at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the bill 7176, which is called . "On monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
It is strange that in fact the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... place, for whom the members of the Supervisory Board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but we do not yet know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards. and then install manual control.
The same as before 2015.
Why should the state companies have supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law "flies" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off ‚Äì for example, it is possible to demolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of management of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible to remotely work supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the Supervisory Board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, it will lead to this!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will make a decision on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be categorized as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, But let's try to understand some of them: "respected foreign experts at the first word "war", in 2021 leave Ukraine, But at the same time, they remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war.
Firstly, this is manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world practice, and in completely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
Don't forget that being a member of a supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 kids with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansk districts of the Kiev region, which were released from the invaders, will introduce a strengthened curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansk districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be in force from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clean up and demining territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There's a word-for-word translation of that document in Czech.
Only below added an explanation of what is inkaso.
I already have an account. I did it at another bank. Because you had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing its army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Swaboda Rada", the human rights center "Vyasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevych, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of the SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Vyasny", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be severely stopped" by the security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway. employee of Baranovichi branch of "BZhD" and administrator of thematic resources "BZhD" in "VKontakte and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the European Union, is imposing new sanctions on Russian President Putin's daughters, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions would freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exodus includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms, the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was the restriction against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
It would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council. including former Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the US.

Good evening, I can't share with you. There is a tip from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he conducts scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, posted a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to fight and a mountain of wounded people.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which takes part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyi assured that the command's communication with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the Azov regiment.
Thanks, I'll stick with you. That would be very good

A squadron of Czech-made drones has started flying over Ukraine from today.
Nearly 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in the various cities where the fighting is currently underway.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, the location of their deployment will be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done, they say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the occupants mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.

Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
The training of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent station of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyrysche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.

The enemy feels a special problem in the recruitment of drivers and drivers.
Departure of selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue to strike at the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or disabling.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in the Izyum direction in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the area of Golden, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue their assault actions in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.

We will certainly try to keep up, but I doubt
How can you want to sleep and I'm holding you
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, then tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, and especially 1+1. We don't need to set up :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language

I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am learning Czech to perfection, I dream to work at Teva
Friends old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have come to hard times.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame about your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you later ‚Äì as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. After the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for very few of you -- those who have worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduga, at Navalny's organization, and in a number of other places -- Have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except for the rallies, when they were still happening.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, perhaps, a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always that way.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy even bloody but real .
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sorrow that you seek salvation behind the tsar, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to lie down, to renew itself. To re-form and take over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and humbly resigned yourself to the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for him, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upswing of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have earned well, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices have risen, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, as I see, you barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.
A bit of outrage, a bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
After the 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you came out in droves to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some people got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I have heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by a pro-Russian president who had deceived their European aspirations, they seized the Maidan once and never left it again.
They built a tent city entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and kick them out if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he seized the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his shakers suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because we stopped communicating right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbags, public waifai and hipster cafes .
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You have barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever ... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I had no idea what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and I saw how on the streets of Homs state snipers shoot in cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I kept silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept silent ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent ‚Äì because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really speaking now ‚Äì like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most of them allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from inside the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny.
As for the others, you know best what country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians ‚Äî or, as seems very likely, if he doesn't ‚Äî he'll take you up on it.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly in private, went to protests and still took a short time, but soon will get more serious.
For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent on social media (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment was given simply for anecdote, are not in the distant past ‚Äì and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who's going to stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more than in 2014, frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive on paper his superiority.
All in all, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, know what is happening.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hogwash , your laws , apart from the repressive ones , are worth no more than the paper they are written on , your last free media is no more , your economy is collapsing faster than I write . you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to leave somehow, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that is looming in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the rallies by itself, as it has periodically happened, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool, the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged in almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many, many millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300,000, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
It's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared if I were you too.
In the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to win it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet and be arrested; Your close friend will make a mistake and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years and will only continue to get worse and bigger.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home

In Kherson, people again came to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived at the scene to disperse.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there, " said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, citizens traditionally gathered for protest actions on Freedom Square - near the building of the regional state administration and the Regional Council.
This square, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of the Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson a special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, it will stop beating ‚Äì we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the armed forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city ‚Äì ED.) are people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in (the area) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it, too.
Then our negotiating situation will be weaker and may not even be interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we State.
We believe in our result, in our victory."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose opportunities for a diplomatic solution, if we have them."
Direct speech: "people will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but –∫–æ–∂–Ω–∞ every family has lost something ‚Äì and I don't think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we don't speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there are no people."

Due to the change in the estesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who took part in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kiev region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Main Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," the report says.
The Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list here.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpen, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, Bucha mayor Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor general Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of dead civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the launch of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and aerial bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal bullying of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century.! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was looking forward to is happening...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the armed forces of Ukraine and never for a moment doubted that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and still am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without Terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to make a copy of the execution case of my great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages long, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate and denied any wrongdoing.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was one of the free people, poor "one-yard" Gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the Plowman and feeder of young children to death.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial site.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give perjury.
In the criminal case, there is a name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An Apple is not far from an apple tree, as you know, Falls...
The firing troika that condemned the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of my great-grandfather, I became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "Immortal barrack", which qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, The Descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers ‚Äì the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were put in prison for it, and there he quickly died.
KGB officers are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and Imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were superimposed on top of the thousand-year horde tradition.
And then they did a brutal genetic experiment on what came out, killing the intelligentsia during several waves of Red Terror.
Watch the semi-French film "the Chekist" from 1992, and so it was.

In Borodyanka near Kiev, during the dismantling of the rubble of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
The defenders of Mariupol announced the spraying of an unknown toxic substance over the city from a Russian drone.

Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.

According to" European truth", This is reported by Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the version on the boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the delivery of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled in by industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full deliveries will not be completed until 2027.
Is it us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you we will find how to top up ryakhonoe and naberkmo. I'll unsubscribe. Thank you

A man and a woman decide their own issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.

I was upset that Kolya and I didn't translate the test well yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them in some way?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to improve my mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that there are no errors.
Thank you for your test tasks
We hope so too
And so she is very happy with any gift
I just wanted to connect the internet to my Czech number
Yesterday, at bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance

So that she doesn't get scared that no one has come
I didn't go. Yes, I baked it myself.  I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So how long are you leaving town?
Six months ago, at the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the foundation that we must protect ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, " then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: Never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the residents of the cities it has blocked and allowed them to die of diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was impossible to imagine not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But " never again!"it doesn't just mean speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine without risks and victims.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be assembled

Call me for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 rubles from the guide
Sergey Sidorenko: our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the revolution of dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full ‚Äì scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens-more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides during the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its members-countries ‚Äì for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, and the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed questions", together with the editor of "European truth", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why security guarantees discussed at negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a Volt partner indicated that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile app

Yes, I had a bad heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me to forgive him.
I turned him down.
Then, some time later, he called that he had had heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe I really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with the baby.

I can't remember this scenario in any way )
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev :they say "we haven't done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "we see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will launch strikes on decision-making centers, including in Kiev, which the Russian army previously refrained from."
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, The Remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babi Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles over the Southern Railway Station, flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, the wreckage of a downed missile of the invaders smashed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenevka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of Mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell"allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are sweating profusely at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this elegant fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against speeding up Ukraine's entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

Your brain can't accept it.
He chips for the old reality.
You call at work to find out whether to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now .... they'll agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go ?? I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I have$ 50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many of our managers were not given wages at our jobs.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for my children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything from the House... you have to go 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you'll have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to night, you drag your children all over Prague.
What's next ? Unknown. How much is it ? Not known. Children ask for sweets. You can't . It's expensive for you.
And with every iron-we do not have such a thing.
We have a choice - to stay there and bring the children into danger, or try to escape here

The head of the presidential office, Andrei Ermak, said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies hand over to us.
Yermak's direct speech: "they understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to" bring down " the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of S - 300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from their allies, and they are massively switching to the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of soldiers of the armed forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the next World.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they did," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports surfaced that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the Kiev suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything possible to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the charges as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another setting of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city before March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, The Investigative Committee of Russia issued a statement in which it announced an "investigation" on charges of spreading "deliberately false information" by Ukraine about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3 accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures.for shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." How the invaders viciously exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list, there is another item about which there is now much less information ‚Äì the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
Ukrayinska Pravda found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the very "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation from Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Iosif Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military camp, although it was civilian.
Like true plastuns, Denis and Marina packed disturbing suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They didn't have their own car, and commuter buses didn't take anyone anymore.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke both non-Russian and non-Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: "Is there anyone?"I say yes. ‚Äì Get out!".
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned about whether they had served in the army.
The women were told:"we have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the troops, young guys of 25-35 years old.
They said: "here we were helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasha bely (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement una-Unso" Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen War ‚Äì up), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same, the Russians will take them" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the internet where children Thank Kadyrov for the food.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a nice cut.
Our child says, " you have 7 days to give away our phones," they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov is also there, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob stores, looted.
They brought chickens for themselves, tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and their white tape to the other, and called it "opolchenka".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
When they were beaten up in Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äì our people constantly got into it from "Bayraktar".
But these people came and told us that the armed forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kiev has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian citizen came to us ‚Äì either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB-and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì it was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "you are being taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "then feel sorry for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house-either with grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some of them did not go, saying that this was for traitors to the motherland ‚Äì they say, "they will shoot you there, sell you for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many of them were without documents at all, because they were burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A rocket fires, and you can see the trail ‚Äì it was an Iskander working in Kiev.
Although these people from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, have an education, and understand what this is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the Sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
Its head, Vasily Stepanovich Venger, came and said: "Here, I am a Ukrainian, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these enemies of yours are reached.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenka!
As he says, so he will."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us in any way, and in Minsk, at the railway station, they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
They didn't hold me by force in the sanatorium.
The migration representative told our second group that you can stay here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier that volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì up), we saw ballistic missile launches on Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say:"you are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland and took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering and deciding what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia now as there are Estonian ones."
Marina lived on the territory of a military camp in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday ?
And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thank you for the arrangement, the bloodworms are good

Can I agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, Bucha mayor Anatoly Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of the dead were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, the headman of the village of Motyzhin, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were abducted on March 23, were found dead and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor ‚Äì in the sewer.
Along the highway 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go no one will be home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the president's Office, writes "European truth".
"All the equipment, everything that they already send, for some types of equipment it was done late.
Therefore, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, and this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war," he added.
Recall that the British prime minister promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and I will return home

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio" was delayed due to imported parts, and my friends and acquaintances were warned not to say too much when they call."
"We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, the spot (cat ‚Äì up) on the belly and hind legs has peeled fur ‚Äì this may be due to stress, food changes and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Spot, unlike his mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito"for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polevaya took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was around were hidden from her ‚Äì formally, as always, I came for a few hours.
But when her friend let it slip, I gave her the radio ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always near the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She didn't hear well, which allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her" walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
Exactly on April 17 - I have cleaning of 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I didn't even think about it :)
Hi, if you need more of our help tomorrow, we can come

I'm telling you the embassies are only here,
Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Erwin Aislinn, a British man who served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of Aislinn's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislinn who spoke with him
Literally, Aislinn's twitter: "we received news from him:' 48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Aislinn served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the armed forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the Defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC reporters contacted the soldier's mother, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had said by phone that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that Aislinn said in a recent phone conversation about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the Brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Aislinn's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called "kadyrovites"without weapons and bullets.
Also in social networks, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed, in which Aislinn allegedly talks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislinn said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they did not succeed.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislinn was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to participate in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the armed forces of Ukraine and took the oath of office.
Aislinn's friends and family called him Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house.
The bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.

You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the Supervisory Board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the Supervisory Board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì this is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the revolution of dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then others may take off tomorrow ‚Äì for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the company's work may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by moving members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
But it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
So, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (mic), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned defense industry enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the law, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members do not perform their duties free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense industry enterprises at all.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the first word "war", leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this is manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, and so on.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other jobs, and it is precisely the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical complaints against members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in a family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, an enhanced curfew will be imposed for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "in the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: according to the head of the regional state administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by Transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to a shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kiev region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complex and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of Railway trains.
Source: Sovye Svaboda, Human Rights Center Viasna, head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of internal affairs Gennady kazakevich, quoted by the State Information agency BelTA
The Ministry of internal affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the power support of the SOBR special forces, and one was wounded.
According to" Viasna", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of internal affairs of Belarus, Gennady kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of Belarusian railways and the administrator of the Belarusian Railways thematic resources in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The Bipol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, the Russian Federation transfers manpower and equipment to Ukraine through Belarus to fight.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's subsidiaries, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, while Alfa ‚Äì Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector exits include manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions was restrictions on large Russian state-owned enterprises in a critical area.
This will prohibit US citizens from making transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former president and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, who conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new communication neurons
Natalia Nagornaya, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was transmitted to her by the military of the 36th marine brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that " the bill goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which takes part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the Defense Forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by soldiers of the Regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, as long as we stay here

A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine since today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will be used to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Loubutenko.
Today their Intermountain friends are headed by the head of the village council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101 / Vasyl Shchur delivered the drones to their intended destination: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, we will keep their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

The invaders tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.

Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transdniestria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdniestrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally:"the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from carrying out provocative actions on the territory of the Transdniestrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: the enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyrishche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the Battalion Tactical Group units from the 36th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the specified brigade are being recruited.
The enemy experiences a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
Departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of combat operations, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses an Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dolgenke and Dmitrovka, but had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasnaya, Rubizhne, Nizhni and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the area of Zolotoye, but had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the Seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolye, Trudolyubovka and Maryanskoe.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, The Defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.

I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know it perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not-so-old friends, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come for you, too.
I've been talking to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is being subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, " Sasha replied laconically as usual. - Now after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others-cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of Thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äì those who worked for Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äì how many of you did anything to resist this regime?
Except perhaps for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "it's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now probably put a big burden on your soul and heart?
This wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy-dirty, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the Tsar's back, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your heart out on the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or chose not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar yurt, Itum Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank and danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me:"Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the mid-noughties, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is it really a problem?
Moscow shone festively and glittered with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others-many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it didn't go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, as I see it, you barely paid attention to this.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West have done much, if at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you came out en masse to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro ‚Äì Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan-and never left it again.
They built a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovich became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it didn't do much good.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly emerged from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks like New after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012-with their binbags, public Wi ‚Äì Fi, and hipster cafes.
Indeed, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You barely noticed Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw State snipers shooting coolly at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I didn't say anything ‚Äì because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I didn't say anything ‚Äì because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I didn't say anything ‚Äì because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really talking now-like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some-from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into the new gulag or keeping Navalny company.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians ‚Äì or, as it seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed ‚Äì he will take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly in private, went out to protest and still got off for a short time, but soon will get a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed yourself in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given just for a joke are not so distant in the past ‚Äì and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians-even more so than in 2014 ‚Äì scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.
Apparently, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, are well aware of what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on your guard.
You understand where this is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, if you don't count the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either leave somehow, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The Spark will not come from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool ‚Äì the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.
There are a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
If I were you, I'd be afraid, too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äì and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online ‚Äì and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only get worse, becoming more and more widespread.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday
We'll be home in the late afternoon

Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people rallied again, the Russians did not have time to disperse them
As the participants of the event told the agency, the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived on the scene to disperse them.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protest actions on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, and there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson with the special title of "Hero City."
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of the enemy to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in (the region of) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to a return even to those cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if we have them."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace either way because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I do not think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for life.
You cannot fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people."

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of servicemen of 64 separate motorized rifle brigades who directly participate in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the message reads.
In GUR MOU, they note that all war criminals will appear before the court and be prosecuted for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders shell and destroy key infrastructure objects, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, aerial bombs.

I am sure that there will be no problems with this.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate the same this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is a person Greek Catholic or Catholic.
in the beginning, you can try it for free
Maybe you can write us a payment algorithm, we will pay ourselves.
We have the paper that children receive at the end of the school year, this is a report card, and they receive a certificate when they are born and married
Yes! He is on it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if it is better. I worry behind the walls of the apartment
They write there that you need to fill out a biography in Czech...
I will try to make it. Because I still have to go to the town hall to sign documents
The wife is not angry that you are on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Mother of God for you.
Let them wrap you in their blanket of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted for a moment that in the case of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It simply cannot exist without terror, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU had a copy of the great-grandfather's shooting case removed: the whole case is more than a hundred pages long, but the death sentence is very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, he had five children, he was from free people, a poor "one-court" nobility, he had never been a serf.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to sentence the plowman and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even learn about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, the knocker's surname is Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
As you know, the apple does not fall far from the apple tree...
The firing squad that sentenced the villagers to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "Bessmertny barak," which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The system first discredited and then destroyed the people who found the mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, he was put in prison for it, and he quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most despicable features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed on the thousand-year-old Horde tradition.
And then on what came out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask my wife what I can buy for a cough?
I'm sorry because I don't have anyone to ask
I also wanted to ask, maybe you know where the children went, because Galya can't tell them
Love, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he has the day off and can go, because the car has not yet been looked at at the station today).
It is very uncomfortable for us to disturb you so much.
You help us a lot, thank you!!

When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
They asked me to convey my congratulations and to say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, which they have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.

And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She thanked me very much, she even cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
There were tears in her eyes.
She said that if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.

Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the meeting
This is true, but we have not yet orientated ourselves in the area and do not know where everything is. Today we looked for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two large ones

I will write to you in any case.

The flowers are blooming. Everything is fine. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As "European Truth" reports, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the Boxer armored personnel carrier version for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is it us in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish the account and let's get it. I will write you back. thank you

For me, marriage is a sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.

Yesterday at bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.

So you are leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the German president.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities blocked by it and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, agree on an excursion, and write when to be collected

Serhii Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbas war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in wartime conditions, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the "Damn Questions" podcast, together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about exactly how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is close, more than ever before in history, and why the security guarantees being negotiated in the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my volt partner, it is marked that my Application is pending.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After some time he came back again and asked for my forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after some time he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him just to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During this time we talked a lot.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "they have never done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see sabotage attempts and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, then the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at the decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army previously refrained from doing."
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupation forces of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, remnants of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in Poznyaki, the capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower in Dorohozhychy near Babyny Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed rocket of the occupiers crushed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vynogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vynogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people died.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that it is still too early for residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and besides, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian projectile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky does not speak so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated blend of power, poignancy and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, that's why we don't want to be considered scammers.

Are you doing well with your imagination??
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.

Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't handle it.
He clings to the old reality.
You call work to find out whether you should go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last long.
Now ... they will agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many people were not paid by our managers at our jobs.
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you have 1000 kilometers to go.
You don't know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what happens next? It is not known. How much? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It is expensive for you.
And of every iron - we don't have one.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [note 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the district election commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only national votes are held: elections of the President and People's Deputies and all-Ukrainian referenda.
Local elections are not held in ZVO.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding weapons that are being transferred to us by allies.
Yermak's direct speech: "They understand that they will lose the war, see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems handed over by Slovakia.
Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already denied this information.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and they are massively transferred to the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn against such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces had committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously injured by Russian forces are deplorable," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after weeks of occupation.
The photos, which allegedly showed the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and the prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were indications that Russian forces had committed "war crimes" in Buch.
"What happened in Buch calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She claimed, without evidence, that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated, without evidence, that the image of Buchi was "another staging by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Buch.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement in which it announced an "investigation" into allegations that Ukraine spread "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke out on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchi to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should bear responsibility for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims strewn on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were strewn on the ground near what local residents said was used as a base by Russian forces.
It appears that the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kyiv that was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is gone." How the occupiers despicably deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to a Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Pravda" sought out the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text insisted on voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the fallen Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepinskyi.
The family of Oleksandr, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr got a job at Antonov Airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, even though it was a civilian.
As true sleuths, Denys and Marina packed their alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At approximately 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 o'clock in the evening on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say so. - "Get out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there were any weapons.
All men were asked whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Belyy (commander of the unit of the nationalist UNA-UNSO "Viking" movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext that "the Russians will take them anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So, after looting the store, they brought sausage and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, so is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought in chickens, tied a St. George's ribbon to one leg, and their white scotch tape to the other, and called her "militia."
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Buchi, so that they didn't even take the killed, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had united squads - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from "Bayraktars."
But they came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is Azov, and, according to them, there are 100,000 Azovs in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian - either an airborne officer or a representative of the FSB - came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was talk about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You will be taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then take pity on the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland - they said, "you will be shot there, sold for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket fires, and a trace is visible - Iskander worked in Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the "Chonky" sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are finished.
Poor people are suffering!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
As he says, so it will be."
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "But you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men can't go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
They didn't help us at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk at the station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were helped a lot by Belarusian volunteers.
We were accommodated in Minsk and escorted.
In the sanatorium, they were not held by force.
The migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a week or a half at most, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly shooting from firing ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals resign from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, they do not believe at all.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their firing ranges are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, we are deciding what to do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian flags."

On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the good news - the Ukrainian military liberated the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that the Russians shot at least 280 civilians in Buchi alone.
They were killed just on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.

The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in blankets were found on both sides of the highway 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, "European Truth" writes.
"All the equipment, everything they're already sending, for some types of equipment it's late.
Because when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have taken a different form.
"It would unfold in a different way, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all," he added.
We will remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio receiver" has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to talk too much when they call."
"We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it works.
However, Plyamka (the cat is UP) had fur on her belly and hind legs - this could be due to stress, a change in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Spot, unlike her mother-in-law, is not deaf, she hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva picked up a weapon for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was nearby - she formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always by the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
Hard of hearing - this allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. These are 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything but the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end

A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a Briton who served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislin who spoke to him
Aislin's twitter verbatim: "We received word from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the Mariupol defense operation.
The BBC's mother, Anne Wood, was contacted by reporters and confirmed that her son had told them on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Aislin told them about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" units without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also circulated on social networks, in which Aislin is allegedly talking to an American friend of hers who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British man said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Aislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took the oath.
Aislin was called Johnny by friends and relatives, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The Bolshevik attackers fully recovered for their losses in the battle.
They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his relative, whose name is unknown, the young man Borys Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep sinkhole that was covered with earth."
According to memories, "there was some dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents would run from house to house in a rush.
Bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were always found on the streets
And maybe I really will follow you. I need you. I can't without you.
3. Which of your own activities/activities would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

I am not afraid of work, since I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can you bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "Regarding the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we are not aware of any company that has had the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The one that existed until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law "takes flight" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take flight as well - for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be demolished.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in one way or another has been circulating among some people's elected representatives for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments used to explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will present our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be possible to prevent it by moving the members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's deputy, author of the draft law, Dmytro Natalukha, provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPK), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
There is a supervisory board only in Ukroboronprom, which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the necessity of relocation of one or another defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of the work of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first word "war" will leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
First of all, it is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also not be forgotten that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people also have other occupations, and electronic means of communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims against foreigners only.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just another convenient opportunity.

In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5..
Details: According to the head of the oblast, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territories.
Omelanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last from 21:00 to 6:00 every day.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osypovychy, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda," human rights center "Vyasna," chief of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, with the force support of "SOBR" special forces.
According to "Vyasna," during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were treated at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovytskyi branch of "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "BZD" in "VKontaktie" and "Odnoklasnyky" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
We will remind: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers manpower and equipment to Ukraine in order to fight.

The United States bans investments in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's daughters, the largest Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions would freeze any of their assets that touch the US financial system and bar US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit US citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day, Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

Good evening, I cannot but share with you. There is news from Mariupol that his son is alive and in the army.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensa, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections
On the morning of April 12, the journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Nataliya Nagorna released a video recording that was given to her by the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhnyi, assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky reported, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good

A squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones started flying over Ukraine üá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional copters<unk> will be used for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers of the "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Volodymyr Labutenko, a deputy of the Mukachevo City Council.
Today, their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones as intended: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use the copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will keep their location a secret for now.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupant and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, gutted panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was taken down.

The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansk direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, the specified weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the personnel losses of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal region) of the 29th combined arms army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen from the said brigade are being recruited.
The enemy feels a special problem when filling the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to attack transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the Zolote area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Visokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it
And how can you want to sleep and I'm keeping you
are you sure you don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I will understand everything)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to configure:)
I will turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package ends today:)
Can we do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I will ask her. I am a little ashamed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
My father and I will meet later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, I guess Google wrote something on its own <unk>Ô∏è. , I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we took the things you brought, but there are things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If it suits the director, then from next week I can start going to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it works out, because there are very long queues) and it rains on Saturday:)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am studying the Czech language in order to know it perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I have been in contact with many of you over the past month.
Your life, which was never easy anyway, turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduza, Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - did many of you do at least something to oppose this regime?
Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the Russian journalist's column "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why so?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, dammit, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to see through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.
A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some received huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I heard it so often and still do.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.
They built a tent city all by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Out of nowhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new as possible after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You just turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or something... Even the editor in Moscow, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I probably didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs government snipers shoot my children's peers in cold blood.
Among all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or keeping Navalny company.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed - he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far met with a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so distant past - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.
In spite of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You understand what it's all about.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a hohma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go some way or get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe under the current conditions, less will be needed from you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.
If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would also be afraid if I were you.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Keep your cool, think strategically and make it happen.
We went to class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday

She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and arrange them in that room with clothes, and yesterday Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her until 7:00 p.m.
Can it really be like that?
