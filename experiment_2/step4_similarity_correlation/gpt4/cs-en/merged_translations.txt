A big comeback for the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is coming back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns in the middle of the Vegas game and has not been on the NHL ice rinks since.
The incident occurred while the veteran goaltender was moving from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in his lower body,” the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called up from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The fullback wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not catch a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, “Francouz” made 36 saves, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles wears a mask on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles has also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC has reported on its website.
They send their wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte is also dressed.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is dressed like Princes George and Louis in shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate have not said, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camilla put on her veil, which matches her light-coloured dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbr a million crowns for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, having been promised a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season by Slavia in Prague.
The efotbal.cz news server reported that he had accessed some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red-and-whites had not committed any corrupt acts.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, which mainly include Slavia's former sports director, Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
The former influential red-and-whites official, according to the file, was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the case file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavia Tvrdík's board of directors.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the case file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We never committed illegal acts, did not seek to influence referees in violation of fair play rules and did not provide any financial compensation to anyone in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, Nezmar is indiscriminately insulting some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and he is also slandering his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by police intervention in several places, including the FAČR's Prague headquarters, in mid-October last year.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (artillerymen have to carry cartridges manually without cover from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting trip right next to town.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
As I was coming in, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came out, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let it come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got down from the perch, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of many things for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put at your feet in a sleeping bag and you'd be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internal Affairs got respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in the past weeks.
iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by memories of ČSLA, which passed through older generations), but the Czech Republic can't benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that the trained could take up, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the reservists' abilities will be rapidly lost in time.
Moreover, modern conventional conflicts, where one can deploy them, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be fought in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we don't have the appropriate geography for it.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them play like they have one.
Then there's this situation where you're looking at a dude who missed an empty goal two minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss guys and you're thinking "wow and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well of course they're going to take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "catching a defender" is so horrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our attacker managed to play one player off his opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals will last for some time, according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the current Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it may cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from previous disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from the results so far.
But the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronaviral pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As said, Merck’s molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak has grown."
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you flatly that they don't.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid to cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both polled at over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the spinning of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr did not want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some supporting device.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in disrepair.
In the second grade we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed too much, but he was our kind of mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was very close, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he went clean-clothed.
He went to school in nature, he did all kinds of monkey business, but he was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Gypsies joined the same class, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, there was often something handled by the police, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the advert (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I have sold often to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to trick me into a price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car that way, the guy called in a month that he had already signed it over to himself..
I say myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just common behavior).
But if someone comes in, reaches out, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes problems.. so it doesn't matter what color he is, but he will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs too.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachaticko
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation care unfortunately she died of her injuries at the scene," South Bohemian Health Rescue spokesperson Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet determined, he went around a bend in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian Police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovicka, according to the Rescue Officer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often don't provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, ordering small packages has become slightly more expensive, he has to add VAT and send the data to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then he just has to fill in the data about the shipment, and if VAT was not included by the trader at the time of the sale, the customs office will charge it from the total amount for the shipment and for the transport.
If the addressee does not ensure customs clearance himself, the reward to the carrier must be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of incoming shipments from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for data to be supplied that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and filled in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Dealing with inflation
See the headline, how would you propose dealing with current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford the usual things, especially energy.
How much did you get, say, a raise (who is the employee)?
I got 2% this year in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even 6 months?
I just don't get it, how can a court send such an animal to prison for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape reports from victims?
The man from the Grave "burnt through" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had called them to her himself.
But he took a detour.
First he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling 911 and were surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide manhunt, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally am of the opinion that we are not Slavic ethnically or culturally any longer, but I would like your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence, just because it could potentially be of benefit.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are probably, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even the Ten Commandments say there is no other god than Yahve.
In that case, wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per year) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All elements of the Czech Armed Forces could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: There is a constant rehash of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies hunt in schools and there is a kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian raider.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a screw-up.
Oh dear.
Just one election in the USA that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The limeys will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they just have to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that has worked as a guarantor of independence in the long term is the armed army to the teeth and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And nowadays any teenager can pilot remote controlled devices, so what can it do.
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks today, but a pimply teenager behind the stick of a remote controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Unwrap your presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're stuffed with boxes and fillers at home?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the involved shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cartons have increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugstore and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are together creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tyres, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPy and other places help to find uses for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily" adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean up the Czech Republic.
What I find wrong is that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying folder filesystem and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let’s Rewrite History, Seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of France’s EU presidency over the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they are impossible to do in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron’s supporters straddling right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for a head of state in April.
The election calendar has affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is ready to create the conditions for such historian work.
Many commentators rushed to criticize Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is trying to defend the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now, arguing that the Vichy regime, which colluded with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had quite a success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea for one history textbook seriously, and let's not look at what happens in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us-versus-them story, and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it held the top spot in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhoea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Trains start running according to the new timetable, some carriers will change
Starting on Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will start running instead of ČD.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
Carriers have started selling tickets already during the autumn.
ČD plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
The trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Alongside domestic services under the new timetable, the lines will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will run other new trains in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the entry on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On the line, RegioJet will run a total of 16 connections daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, as well as a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
For example, passengers are awaiting changes in Českolipsko, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by Czech Railways by German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains.
Passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
Nobody even tells you in the schools that the blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
Nobody teaches you in the school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I didn't see anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history isn't black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn it without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do that again.
By the way, speaking of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good successes, too, and it seemed absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was a slaver, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I wouldn't compare that to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and our point of view may not exist with them (there was a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was appalling, those students were quite radicalized and those schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I am a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer the same, it has radicalized itself.
Nowadays, feminists are called those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, so other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side as well, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I encountered rather bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I didn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some bullshit about the coronavirus that everybody's ashamed of.
Then of course there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestants, but in fact they're born out of Catholic modernity and they're effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services with the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanicka Street.
Otherwise St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even do a Latin mass there every Sunday at 3:00, like they did before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for it because of the coronavirus pandemic, but took it from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
They also took it at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we take part in with the troop every year, I am looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav in the parking lot.
But usually scouts take the train to Vienna for it.
Nothing changes about the delivery of the flame around the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The subsequent delivery of the light on Saturday, 18 December will be taken care of by the Scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains as well as by passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken in the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Scouts must adhere to the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of the local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem Light is for believers a symbol of hope, light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event involves hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will put the money to good use, but I don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it's producing a useless product and it's eroding the free market and "the natural life of the company."
I work in a factory myself where there are a million signs in the corridors "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development where this company is just hanging on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught up in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so clever that you can't always help it.
For this reason too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something the majority believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I'll claim is a cryptic thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen in love with the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen in love with the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will present a record of more than two hundred to their audiences at the premiere.
The IMDb film database operator has calculated this.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and has been increasing the audience significantly, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year there were four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love in Heaven and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real Christmas boom didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC recalled.
Its advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22, and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
This year, the rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't really matter, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, the author of a book about Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, describing the genre with exaggeration.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," added Gray.
For example, according to Gray, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which of course is resolved and the two of them kiss.
It goes on and on, and as long as all the films look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for covid-19, will not be involved in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not be involved in the final race of the season.
Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he should have been attacking the better position from the 20th position he took in qualifying.
However, Russia's Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not be involved in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in the end.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen, taking on Lewis Hamilton in a straight battle for the title.
Mazepin, according to Haas, is relatively well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically well because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any replacement would have to go through qualifying or driving at another part of the weekend.
There is no first driver involved with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the season just ending, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can also be arrested for this.
And no one will care that the boss said.
According to the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater stuns!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater its softness," says the creator, who does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with months-long actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory. _____________________________________________________________________________
The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
The health department is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
“We are currently reporting another suspected variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school is not proven,” said Ciupek.
Six cases occurred in the region during the week.
“We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that there are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, and four have a asymptomatic course.
No one with a suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of those mentioned has traveled abroad, nor has any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, said Ciupek.
The chief health officer, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament that was held in Brno a few weeks ago is being examined.
Players from South Africa were there, and a Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales.
It wants to do like Texas on abortion bans.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which kept Texas' abortion ban in place, albeit going against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the U.S. up to roughly 24 months of pregnancy.
The court, however, was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, enforcement of the ban in this case has been made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect people's lives," Newsom continues.
He says he has instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the secretary of justice on a measure that would authorize public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are labeled.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, components for "ghost weapons," or sets for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern US state. _____________________________________________________________________________________
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where you gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule is going to look like and you also improve the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4 dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on inactivated virus, which promises up to 10 times more potency according to the manufacturer's specifications, should be on the market soon.

Poland Threatens to Stop Payments to EU Budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw €36 billion from the EU recovery fund for economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Poland's judiciary underwent under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, puts "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "political dictates carried out by blackmail and by trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels as to limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But knowing about it... In Lidl they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yoghurt too many times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes on the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they had all selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and lactose-free zone...
If there's no need, I won't go to any more market, action or no action, golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and there's an order to it, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't really care anymore.
For two years I've watched data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more off the mark than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion is going on at the technical level, but only extreme views are getting into the public arena.

Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.

Ew, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the spoon and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get hit a few times on the butt (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than to words.
The important part, I think, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice in its own way whether to disobey and get it, or to be better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, I mostly just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the System
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter to which he was sworn and about which he had been taught in school since childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement which could be changed if necessary, he was decidedly in favour of the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and are better spared with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl gloated at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
Among other things, the Constitution is a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians to bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in Brno University Hospital they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, they speak about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place in the clinic of paediatric infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
In hospitals there are also children in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"Currently, a child of several months and adolescent age is lying with us," said the head physician.
He is pleased, however, that there have not been any childhood deaths from coronavirus at the children's hospital FN Brno.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend vaccination in children as well," added the doctor.
In the rest zone you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones are not that big.
They are visible on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game preserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside of marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course outside national parks it is not so much guarded).

He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of controlled contagion and authoritarian regime facing crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of controlled contagion and authoritarian regime facing crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to stop a contagion that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support, or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: do you want an elephant?
I've got one and it's great.
The wife is happy because she eats grass, she washes the car with her trunk, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000,- I'll sell you an elephant.
A friend: all right, high five, it'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant shit everywhere, the car is sitting down, the kids are scared of it and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold says: you talk bad about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will succeed.
It occurred to me, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on English, so maybe I'm quibbling.
I'm just basing it on the fact that the ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and mandarins" are no longer clear that they're from Spain.
I'm basing it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already covered in the broad term, and there's no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before being flushed down and laughed at by its heartless owner.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned it from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who look after Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
The mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates Court, she was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and has to pay the equivalent of £12,000 in legal costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: 'Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.'
It took Milly time to get used to humans again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her flat on a drug charge.
In the footage Milly can be heard swearing in a vulgar manner.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying: 'Do you want cocaine?'
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than $50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take away the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of cramming, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Just take the test to one, and then no one cares.
Go out and ask randomly people on the street if they can figure out the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't give a shit and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the lot of people who are going to need that particular thing.
But, like, I was totally serious about saying that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is a punk sign.
(Which in our country probably includes our communist past and our rampage against the educated and the elite) But the cost of having barbarians stand by those machines is just high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid here probably never reached this size.
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland now," Andrea responded on Instagram in Stories to prying questions from curious fans about what had disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Things had been grinding between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused to do so.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect, even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri fumed in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife did not appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment at all on such things, and even in the family, we've never said these things to each other very much.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who tries to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but most importantly, we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he ended up stealing less than 330 kroner from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana as he did so.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
They subsequently arrested Cao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And because he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and tied in effect to the Pandemic Emergency.
If it is repealed, the Act will not be effective.
The Act does limit the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not repealed.
More than 60 % of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart.
On Saturday, 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said ČSÚ Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komní na Uherskohradišťsko, Saturday's elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two mandates.
The Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The incumbent mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privately.
The Komňans – independent candidates – achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In Rovná na Pelhřimovsku, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 went to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice na Mostecku again.
It won 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came second, with 43.27 percent of voters voting, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nova Ves na Liberecko were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nova Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the Association of Independent Candidates, thus gaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, winning one more seat and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to "argue" with.
If you don't, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I do care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
The incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
The workers of the regional operations center took over an hour after Saturday midnight emergency call with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – went to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as well as it should and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airway, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus because of inadequate reactions from the public and authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had a spectacular gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña was able to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, he produced a great choke hold against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one had expected.
This was the women's bantamweight bout between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the fight as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to knock her down.
Peña, however, was not compelled to make any more mistakes, and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was riveting, and for MMA fans very tense.
Both opponents came up with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Peña got Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up and knock the attack off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier did better, but gradually the tables began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
He didn't do that very well, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of punches.
That was how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the choke off.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a supreme triumph, putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of accurate shots and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to take on Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it is not complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When declensing, they then take on double endings and in some cases remain in the non-tilted form.
For example, the words “lump” or “hip” are masculine and feminine, in the former they are declensing according to the pattern “machine”, in the latter according to the pattern “song”.
For another group of nouns, different shapes are already in the first instance of the singular, for example: “line/line”, “kodluben/kodlubna” or “potato/potato” (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-scriptural, similarly to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-inclined, but they gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image" which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet" which has remained non-inclined in the middle genus, but has endings in masculine according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to come to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
Tensions are running high on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started to make their way towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What exactly motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation right on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we choked, describes Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to have to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who've been raped and I've seen how those people are often treated by their environment or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusation is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Buildings under construction flood the Czech Republic, families have no money to finish
Prices of construction materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a precarious situation because of this.
They do not have the means to finish the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into houses under construction and not under construction.
In a worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and to pay rent on top of that," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and for fifty percent, this has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even though the materials have become more expensive.
So we are working without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the construction of the house costing them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," said Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment have become the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with a lack of labour.
In the Czech Republic, graduates in construction are missing and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by a pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But real visions are missing, says ČRO – myRozhlas commentator
Beyond the classical celebrations, politicians' speeches have traditionally accompanied the entry into the new year.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As a thesis, I find my thesis great right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's, I always work on it for a year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Stationery is completely at peace with us, unless you are a total macaque and something is left in your head, so the board won't stifle you unnecessarily on a theory.
For example, I studied for a week for my stationery and when I was at a loss, the board always tried to lead me on some logical inference, which came right to me and I got it right.
Anyway, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's an exam that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
Don't flood your emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along because otherwise, something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie-the-Pooh.
You need to put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's butt or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws a wrench at artists.
Once you don't give stories every day, and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to a bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which feature is more important, like, comment, or save.
It's really pissing me off lately, so I might have to stoop to tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my line of work have been successful and almost won't let it happen.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly to come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Workers' Party on Donbas
The Union - yes, breaking up - no, the opponents of breaking up the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the unlawful breaking up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Belarusian Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open leniency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With the stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early nineties, the population of Russia has declined by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the White Forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, tore away from the world's greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "the vacuum of strength."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I won't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit about how if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed bad, rotten or poor is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to see Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I had a hunch that it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it I found who published it and eventually it came out Scientology.
Well, it was good stuff, full of completely useless lectures, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
A waste of paper, for this the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail make you want to accommodate that person because you like them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times for going out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from running amok again.
A person like that sucks your feelings, your emotions and your overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When there are insurance companies crawling around furiously buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under five days of house arrest.
In the West, they've stopped the shenanigans and accepted that there's no point in solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has yet to steal something and drive his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we're getting some good old-fashioned junk back.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this nefarious business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "don't worry about it, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered because I wanted to help people, however, the training was more about how to scare and talk a person down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to swing a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made you feel like a pot peddler.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, you learned not to jump on every fad and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced many of these things in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business and don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluations happen somehow, in the form that we do it quite well (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what came out and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you on some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes you feel like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation well.
But it works that way they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman reported missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Jakub Kulhánek, the minister of foreign affairs in resignation, announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradišť had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
Our condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before boarding to collect money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, with Interpol listing her as a missing person around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police had already arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what they suspect him of, but they have not disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná na Pelhřimovsku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections for the councils in these four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, the highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hitches.
To come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and of his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening, however, as others here mention, are very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure shredding a file would even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Increasing number of people under 35 who go a year without sex
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority for young people, may have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriage, with only 5% saying they have not had sex in the last year as of 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that they are a minority among unmarried individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says of the 30%.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without a job or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandating covid vaccination is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we are responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves. ________________________________________________________________________________
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about religious people.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to a boathouse so that we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one of these pretty wide streets, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell all over us.
Luckily, I escaped, but she and a friend got talking.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must collectively make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, should be solved, according to the Chancellor, using diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group," comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered the migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegally).
He has discussed with the chancellor further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured DPA that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunk Polish nun responsible for accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was being driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When the cops told her that she could still lose her license for not giving her the right of way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked her for help.
The cops then came for Sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her license after they found out that she had a blood level of over two milligrams.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing his best.
But Juraj Sajmovič did not guard his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they have forgotten the essential thing: the laws of the cinematic craft.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, another film called Here We Guard is now courting the audience's emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj Sajmovič Jr., loosely builds on his previous film, Here I Guard, from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava that is dying, start inviting dog-walkers to it, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also a producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative pair wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or the church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog-walker competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving on tip-off in search of “drugs” and discussing over herbs the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the boarding house, of course, gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits with her hair waxed and makeup on a cigar at the family table demanding her father's whiskey and floss as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that “this sometimes happens after a coma.”
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to build bearing situations, feeling for the characters' characters as well as the punchline and direction.
The performances are uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
However much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to endure their parties, they have little to play.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic footage of Šumava's nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch several characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar terms the characters commit.
The argument is not even the age-old membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Knowledge of craft must be behind good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man and dog if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canisteraphy this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listen to this shit all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost total absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore more of an exception.
It is good for us.
It has not rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively during the winter months, and is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just forests, but also supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have warned of drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that precipitation may decrease here, depending on global warming and climate change," Israeli Water Management Authority spokesperson Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
Tank trucks are increasing on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker truck driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had brought "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz said he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had brought "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I used to pry the lady a little and grill her during an interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Eventually I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I gave the lady a few more moments of doubt and questions and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at ski lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country tracks and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Area Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the resort in Branna in Šumpersko were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
The operators of the ski resorts can sell the ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from the covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski rental shops and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
She expects a greater surge during the ski course period.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in ski equipment rentals as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost rented.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand for ski rentals at the Novako resort on Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must order them in advance now.
"We are starting renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school, she says.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a good life here, as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people go abroad who have no assets here.
The owner of a company really doesn't just go abroad.
But the rest I totally agree with.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't have the vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started so that one fine day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the Czech Republic can't find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is elections at all.
If living here is bad, some traditional V4 lunatic can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, leaving his supporters and people whose assets can't be put on a plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand, the crew of The Island, headed by Jiri Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, was a "nurse's assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, a children's hospital affiliated with Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," a group of health institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srncová during a press conference on Saturday, is also calling for public cooperation.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," said Harman.
Police had earlier arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers" but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we exaggerate the threat of Invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what you deduced that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons with the situation in '38 are off on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it is not going to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That's about it and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in effect in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are awaiting several changes starting on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, the fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will start running through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
In the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station, the fast train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will newly stop.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslavsko will be included, including lines extending to the Liberec and Královéhradecký Regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and the operation will be adjusted to 12 functioning ones.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague Zličín, which will go as far as Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened during the morning peak and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will newly start.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They start from the Střížkov metro station, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné in Podještědí.
Conversely, the operation on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines is newly cancelled or limited, including to Mochova, Dobříš or Rozmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers at other places.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
Lines 540 to 543 on Nymburk have been changed and some bus routes on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region are being modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy only pizza buns and yogurt and apple for snack.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, unfortunately, that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but revelations about the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept the love from them for six months.
"I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But she says he picked her up, not the other way around.
They have been the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether those who are not interested at all and are jumping out of the can, or we, whose lives they are thoroughly dissecting.
As if any of you would like to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are suited to each other, or insist that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was visiting to prepare her new fashion line.
Nedvěd has been a long-term vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They've come clean now, waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, but they haven't been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and are happy for us, thank you.
We're just people, too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think our hearts are in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him by me, I'm by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commentators have probably already said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that colleges are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems like the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Flats are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francie etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the neighborhood of Veveří is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it's fine, besides it's close to most of the BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you're going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they can go according to the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he throws in a few crowns on a full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach what he wants in the schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, made such comments about a petition for boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is for you the same as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloguing/digitalisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it out of the way, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it altogether.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on which program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look up the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more like the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than the Odrynian?
PSS: someone's already cracked this for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what the 'subject' of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents approved are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English isn't enough for that anyway, that's a matter for the lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus with the English it's quite interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hate in Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years and it's totally fine.
I drive home from work at 10 p.m. and never have any problems.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of flats are there now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without both Dada and mistress Gelem like a stake in a fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
Dada wreath I saw and Lucie must have one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras' words that he visits her often.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met Anna, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I'm sure to buy Dada and Lucie something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video launch at Club Richman.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
The cops are few and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes on the head of previous governments, not the army, they have been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and there is less rainfall in places where there has been no shortage of water.
The drought that is occurring in a large part of Central Europe is caused by climate change.
But the impact is amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a total gimmick.
And whether you're a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's compared.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators what they point out, what the referees notice they don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And even if it was the other way around it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Outbreak in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily outbreaks.
5766 people are hospitalised.
A total of 34 451 people have died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are at 100,000 in the Czech Republic in 1967, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of outbreaks in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new outbreaks have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered outbreaks in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of outbreaks, caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Health Security Authority, said on TV on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after the outbreak, and deaths about three weeks after the outbreak.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A Johnson government minister defended the quiz being "virtual," over a computer.
But groups of staff gathered around computers were attending it in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
They will be elections of pan-European significance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from this, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one so far is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is markedly different.
Before, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to the independent media, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the indications of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time I was 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it hits extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I'm very choleric and I was angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, they took me to the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me educatively, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by violence now, as a little girl I used to fight quite a bit, now I hit something for discharging myself, and as a younger girl I slapped my parents hand maybe (not to get too much slapped), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, hopefully every parent just screws up something, it's probably impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why an OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call cunts those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise I wonder if you're afraid of an income shortfall?
Can you really count on people wanting the product and buying it and you'll have something to pay the mortgage with?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but it also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the leaders of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How crucial will the trial be for Slovakia?
The journalists are enormously to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition by the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and society got hurt.
On Czech TV, they were dying with covid just six months ago.
Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is nowhere to be found
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and authorisation of a deep-sea repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep-sea Repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the law a significant strengthening of their possibilities in the decision-making of the repository, as has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposal of the law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given site.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before launching a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal for a substantive intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for the municipalities for the whole process of locating and selecting the site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a site for the repository.
Only in certain permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or the minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit decides.
Possible legal action does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploratory or construction works.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform asks for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting a repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is supposed to be almost 4 million crowns, according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against deep repository said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of the municipalities for such a crucial building similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform against deep repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The Platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for potential storage be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: he lost 200 pounds.
Although he didn't feel the need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 200 pounds, which is half his original weight of 180 pounds, reports The Sun.
He flaunted his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a college text, I'd probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who don't need to be beaten at all in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly confront them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
Then there are mini bosses.
It's not possible to translate the boss in a one-word word word kind of way, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (interesting is maybe only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It's simply significant for a story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been wanted since 7 December.
She is also helping British police through Interpol.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular about her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"Czech police are working closely with British police," said police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra has already been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She should be from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The MP Harriet Harman has also been involved in the search for Petra.
She has been involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who he is or what he had to do with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month's attacks significantly intensified as the end of the year approached.
A large campaign related to Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is supposed to attract the attention of the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt repairs for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
The spyware Formbook also remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but remains behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have seen a significant decrease and dampening of activity with the Fareit program, which was behind 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
Today's demo of smarts who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reports.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and in my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-gypsyists and associates alone couldn't fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are on the rise in popularity, reminding me of A Million Moments for an Inside-Out Democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose or more-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's obvious that we'll have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which mankind is rightly proud.
End of Stalemate, Bulgaria Has a New Prime Minister Announcing Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change to form a new government, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has lasted since April, when the last government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
The 'covertly' footage has become a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to police, her previous employer or an MP representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
'Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her,' Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video posted on Saturday.
'Her family in the Czech Republic are very worried about her too and just want to know where she is,' she continued.
The missing Czech woman is reported to have left work around 7.45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reported missing on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, was a nursing assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, a children's hospital affiliated with Guy's and St Thomas'.
“We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group of health institutions said in a Twitter post.
“We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Šumperská amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a pirate county councillor) was reported anonymously for violating copyright by her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Krteček in Šumperské rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover was gaping for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The municipality referred complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it did not react, the hole gaped on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "intensively solve the situation".
The great comeback of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz called up to NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find himself in goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Pilsen or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was substituted in the middle of the game against Vegas and has not appeared in an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The graduate of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and didn't play a single game in the pandemic-shortened season.
In the NHL, "Francík" has played 36 games, and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles masks up Camilla for Christmas card as William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wishes public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camilla to put on a face mask at the races.
The British news broadcaster BBC reported this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, as is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk for a Christmas card photo.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, have also published a picture that will serve as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face mask, helps Camilla put on her mask, which is colour-coordinated with her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied this.
Prague - Detectives in the current corruption case allegedly worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported on this, saying that it had gained access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-whites did not commit any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
According to the file, the former influential functionary of the red-and-whites was in frequent contact with both Berbra and the former sports director of the then second-division Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives were reportedly working with information that Slavia had promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The police had information that Roman (Berbr) had been promised a million-dollar bribe by officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal actions, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by a police operation in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in mid-October last year.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping the cold war.
The cannons will be new, but basically inferior (gunners have to carry the cartridges manually, without cover, from an armoured cabin).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting ground just outside the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course, after a while, the fox came.
I let it come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a trick.
By the time I got down from my perch, it was gone.
I.e. even a meadow can be prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuables in a visible place at your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior procured respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for professions most affected by the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, which the older generation experienced), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that could be used by the trained, we don't actually have modern equipment even for the current professionals, moreover, modern technology is more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-train someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be waged in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography.
We just don't have the individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This then leads to a situation where you look like a dude who missed an empty net two minutes ago, driving into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss players, and you say to yourself "wow, and what do you think will happen now?."
Well, of course they're going to recruit him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "tackle the defender" skill is so terrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker was able to beat one of the opposing players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will continue for some time and, as is known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity gained from previous experience of the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected silver lining entered the COVID equation this week: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovide from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape in the first place also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in these studies is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown."
See, you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist animals.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and a media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France that Le Pen and Zemmour, according to the poll, both have over 20%.
We even know that there are three completely identical buildings in the Czech Republic.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for reasons of security or the speed of deployment of warheads due to its more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire missiles, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he came often and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or telephones, he came cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in the countryside, he did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully he never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, gypsies, started in the same grade, different class.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to trick me with the price, communication was easy.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself.
I say of myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But if someone comes, stretches out a hand, inhabits flats and houses, has nothing but a mess around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been established, drove into oncoming traffic on a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where post is often free," says the collector.
Since October, it has become slightly more expensive for him to order small consignments, he now has to add VAT and submit data to the post office for customs clearance.
He gets an e-mail saying that customs is expecting a package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming mail from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Tackling inflation
According to the headline, how would you suggest dealing with the current inflation?
Inflation is currently at 9.9% and is expected to rise further.
In your opinion, what should the state do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
In Poland, for example, we are seeing a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way forward for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable about where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get as a bonus (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while I am employed.
Can someone explain to me why proven rapists are only sent to prison for six months?
It just boggles my mind how a court can send an animal like this to prison for only 6 months, only for him to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victims from reporting?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob unintentionally helped officers to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had called them to her.
But he did it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In reality, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we have not been Slavs ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague for the USA:')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
Even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
In such a case, would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods and having the one true god, whom I just missed, send me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the Czech Army could do with something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
Let's put it this way: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and a kind of intermingling is taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongolian invader will ever invade here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if the shit hits the fan.
Well, bless her heart.
All it takes is one election in the US to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they have to do is turn their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled vehicle, no matter what.
We don't need border fortifications, that's nothing these days, but a pimply teenager behind the knob of a remote-controlled device can manage.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home inundated with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Upon agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since the price of packaging cardboard has risen by 50% in the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filler material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of cartons.
We will use everything to pack shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tyres, used electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste are gradually increasing," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app, or indeed mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem and folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend - it starts in January - and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, in the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, who straddle the right and the left, agree on little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new presidential election in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't they be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was at the top of the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins won best actor in Berlin for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than the regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't claim that everyone feels this way)

Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure will be adjusted, or their route will be slightly adjusted.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections daily, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
After its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will be replaced by Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, the carrier has also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible, despite the planned closure works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Ceskolip region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and how they had to work and die.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
They don't even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, killed them, while they were killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I won't deny that (in Japan, for example, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, when it comes to the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and they didn't like a lot of things either.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and what's more, our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT from a television where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalised and the schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalised.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always comes out with some bullshit about the coronavirus that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to services with the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there, every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna to pick him up this time either. In the morning, they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was also accepted at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts travel to Vienna by train.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light on Saturday, 18 December, travelling on selected fast trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, so that they wear masks, try to keep their distance, there are as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, of light overcoming darkness.
In the Czech Republic, boy and girl scouts have been promoting it for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being spent on agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I myself work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that employs x number of people, this is hindering development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes, even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm swayed by internet ads, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so contrived that you can't always avoid it.
This is another reason why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I'd ban the internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'll claim to be cryptic thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will premiere a record number of more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with this period, and the films Home Alone, Love Actually and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom in Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning in its viewers for Christmas on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival network Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, what matters is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel, for two hours at least, a little bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which of course is resolved and they kiss.
It's like this all over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, will not take part in final F1 race
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will therefore appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher starting from the last place and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively well and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any replacement would have to qualify or drive in a different part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not encounter COVID-19.
At the start of the season just ending, Kimi Raikkonen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And no one will care what the boss said.
From a legal point of view, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.
Section 152 Spreading of a contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the danger of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two years to eight years,
c) if by such act he violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious bodily harm.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three years to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious bodily injury to at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater astounds!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn a lot," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over the course of six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and the company Swarowski supplied 2,000 decorative crystals.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been going on for several months, inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms and four have no symptoms.
No one suspected of being Omikron has travelled abroad
None of them have travelled abroad, nor have any of their families, and there has been no contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after an embryo's heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to recover damages from anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Texas' ban on abortion, even though it went against nearly 50 years of precedent that established a right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He said he had instructed his staff to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is the name given to home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, when the vaccination schedule is gradually worked out and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
Israel, for example, is already rolling out a large-scale study on the effects of the fourth dose.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market soon.
The amount of teaching material can be left as it is.
But rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
These things could be really brutally reduced.
On the other hand, how many people leave primary school with some basic financial literacy?
And the other things he'll need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland has threatened to stop paying into the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting illegally if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from an EU fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And she is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified by the fact that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is creating "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political diktat carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
But to get to the bottom of it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I met one yoghurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I won't go to any market, event or no event, the gold shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I couldn't care less.
For two years I've been watching how data is treated like manure here, most anti-vaxxers are just a little more out of touch than most pro-vaxxers.
Although a rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are getting into the public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But no one is addressing the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states.
Phew, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
When I was a child, I was punished with boiling water.
It was never about grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a punch (sometimes, even after another "catch," she just brought the spoon and put it where I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of blows to my buttocks (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and be punished, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, I usually only needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document, to which one swears an oath and which has been taught in school since time immemorial, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we have agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
At the time, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question in the same way that Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage.
Recently, however, lawyers are increasingly of the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example, the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, a constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians down with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to wield their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby at the Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course tends to be much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Only recently have very seriously ill children with coronavirus been admitted to the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-Covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults, but also adolescents and babies of a few months.
There are also children in hospitals in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"We currently have a child several months old and an adolescent," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part of the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-Covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccination dose for children as well," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest areas aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in the national parks outside the quiet zone (but do not climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You are not allowed to ski/cycle in the forest off the marked trails unless you have a special permit (but of course this is not so strictly enforced outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He grew up with the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Salda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
It cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China creates the impression of a controlled contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better able to face the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was fending off criticism that it had failed to stop the disease from turning into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
His wife is happy because he grazes the grass, washes the car with his trunk and the children play with him.
It's just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: let's high-five, that'll be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for, an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car is falling apart, the children are fighting over it and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it has been working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.
I thought of that, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and does not need to be further specified for American forces.
But then again, maybe I'm just playing with words:D
Either way, it's a pointless request.
An earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded in Tokyo.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and the surrounding areas were hit by a 5.0-magnitude earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings shook in the capital, but no damage was immediately reported.
No tsunami warning was issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it away and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
She has now been banned from keeping animals for life at Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reports.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who have been caring for Milly since her ordeal said they had never seen a marmoset so distressed.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily back playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay court costs of 12,000 crowns.
Small Monkeys rehoming team leader Steph Sawyer said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will go on."
It took time for Milly to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement caused her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she is settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The mental scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after raiding her flat on drugs charges.
Milly can be heard swearing profanely in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "You want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder eggs at her home.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row, if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you get the same things in first grade that you got in sixth grade?
And it's all killed by the idea of cramming, when nobody, with honourable exceptions, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the vast majority don't give a shit and will tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they studying for?
I'm a big fan of universal background checks, and the reality is that people don't want them and they don't need them.
And at that point, it's pointless and you're never going to get it in them anyway.
They learn it partly for the many people who will need this or that thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all that when you're standing at the machine, I meant that completely seriously... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elites probably play a part) However, the price of having barbarians standing at these machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, Covid would probably never have reached such proportions here.
Married at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the inquisitive questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Kadri and Andrea have been at loggerheads since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! was Kadri's angry response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Even his younger sister Linda did not like the alleged honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in my family, we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for putting on a brave face and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole the equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
He is then seen on one of the security cameras walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
It subsequently detained Cao.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.

The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's council elections in four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said the vice-chairwoman of the CSO, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, gaining 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Private Citizens, was again elected to the council on their behalf.
Komňany - independent candidates - won one seat in the municipal council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member assembly.
The second place went to the candidate Obec pro lidl, which received the votes of 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by the independent candidates Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and, in contrast to the regular elections in 2018, strengthened, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of ecclesiastical buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell headfirst from a height of twelve metres.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, with rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Services intervening on his behalf.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
After arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal has caught on in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire brigade went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The doctor who intervened intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman for the regional emergency medical services, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and medical staff who are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Pena managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Victory also went to Kai Kara-France, who quickly dispatched Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf," Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even hit her opponent with a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents played with a lot of excellent strokes and hard hooks.
Peňová also pushed Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the attack.
The American shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the tables gradually turned.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to overpower his opponent with an armbar.
He didn't quite manage that, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a number of punches.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira landed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a moment, but then had to tap out the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who had already deployed a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of well-aimed punches and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then handled Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter; now, after seven years, she lost.
This hip or that hip?
At first glance, there is nothing complicated about it.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and it is therefore not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the gender is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When folded, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unbent form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern "machine," in the latter according to the pattern "song."
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/row," "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (meaning food).
Both forms are grammatical, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly, there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "moat" and "moat," "doughnut" and "doughnut," etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally oblique, but they are gradually adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image," which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet," which remains uninflected in the middle case, but in the masculine case has endings according to the pattern of "castle."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the precarious route?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
Devastating fires, which Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to gloss over it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "many of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sexual abusers.
Houses under construction are flooding the Czech Republic, families do not have the money to complete them
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the family houses that are under construction and the banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete family houses that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best-case scenario, people are moving into unfinished and unregistered houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can not afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and this has happened to us in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are working without earnings," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had calculated that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper and iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
However, construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is being held back by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable.
"In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But a real vision is missing, says a commentator of the Czech Radio - mujRozhlas
In addition to traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
That's why I think the diploma is great, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely relaxed in our country, if you are not a complete idiot and have something left in your head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle you with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got and I got it right.
As for the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there is an exam at the end of the course, which reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defence.
Everything's fine, but don't inundate them with emails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in a way that he's touching Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta puts obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post a story every day and a new picture at least every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they keep changing what function is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save.
It's really pissing me off lately, so I might have to stoop to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and they don't give a shit.
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly comes along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Party of Workers of Donbass
Union - yes, break-up - no, this is how the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open connivance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, they put the brakes on agriculture, they tore away from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it, put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Just recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take things like that to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nowhere was there anything about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless instructions, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
What a waste of paper, the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
The psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with the person because you like him, without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on her knees not to go.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started being cheated on.
I then ended the relationship by telling her I was separating and lied to her but said we could talk about it next week to calm her down and stop her from running amok.
Such a person will drain you of your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing here by buying a cloud of tests and chasing the positive ones, who would not even know about this terrible disease without the test.
All we achieve is complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have already stopped the charade, recognizing that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we're back to the same old shit.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it out (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in that, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk them down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to sell a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, and I learned not to jump on every rumour and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't poke their noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation does take place, in the form that it does in our country (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, and the like.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are a kind of quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But that's how it works, they don't bother us too much as long as the results are there.
A Czech woman who went missing in the UK has died.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, no further information will be released at this time.
My sincere condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on the bus on her way home from work, where she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol included her among the missing around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.
At the end of the year, four municipalities gained new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won mandates.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
At the very beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease, but it went without any major hiccups.
I'm still struggling to come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population, at all levels, is about this.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not animals.
He would be deprived of the post of president and of the ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are, as others have mentioned here, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Growing number of under-35s have gone a whole year without sex
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight per cent to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to be sexually active, with only 5% saying in 2021 that they had not had sex in the previous year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious belief also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30% consider it to be a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or on a low income are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole Covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a segment of the population into behavior they don't want, but which may save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, in which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we do not order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old person who did not really know much, we did not explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he did not get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be held responsible for the death of a hardened anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, is shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have only themselves to blame.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I do have a story, but it's not about a churchgoer.
One day in high school, our teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and what do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group," which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially provoked a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and a weapon, as night after night we register hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was already driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving licence for failing to give way and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, reported TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had bumped into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
She was breathalysed and had her licence immediately suspended after her blood alcohol level was found to be over two per mille.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to answer for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovic, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film, Here We Are, is now competing for viewers' emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film, I'm Watching Over Here from 2012.
Hugo, the talking dachshund, and some of the familiar characters around him return.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog walkers, Julia's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog film, but there they were at least entertained by children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that the miraculous process of the dog's recovery can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, is astonished at how much content, full of implausible situations and figures, was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog-walking competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilising power of bone meal over herbs - and who, of course, get drunk in the guesthouse.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table, dolled up and made-up, with a cigarette, demanding her father's whisky and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "sometimes this happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build situations, a feel for the characters and the point, and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their own, they don't have much to play for.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch in a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-whistles, let alone the more vernacular profanities the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even the long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not succeed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to incessant abuse exactly from morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how little you understand, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job to earn extra money.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen in some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced a resident of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are susceptible to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in rainfall," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or the recycling of waste water.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
The number of tanker trucks on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, is increasing.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
Clashes erupt between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said the talks in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I teased her a bit and grilled her in conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a thug, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers headed for the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
The downhillers were not deterred by the obligation to show a COVID-19 certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the trails and the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were lucky with the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really worked since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, Jakub Hanuš, praising the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena in Karlov and the resort in Branná in Šumperk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn sketch centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales outlets are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more pressure during the ski courses.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové-based company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that, due to Covid-19, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, the pandemic has made people lazy and they have learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, the rental company in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent the runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include the socialist health care system, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Clever and resourceful people who have no assets here are leaving for other countries.
The owner of a company doesn't just go abroad.
But I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when, one fine day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position any day now.
Another question is the elections.
If life is bad here, then some traditional V4 lunatic could win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman MP, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have a particular responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working for our health service here," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine like that.
These are not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our involvement.
I quoted above.
I don't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of an expensive joke, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is wrong on so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Well, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague on Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will see several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run, which pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will now be extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including routes that cross over into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be closed, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will be newly launched.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, operations on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, have been cancelled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to railway modernisation, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines, and a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being expanded with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a standard 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy next door or Lidl a little further away.
Since I don't do any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and the most I can buy in a hurry is a pizza bun and a yoghurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket that is healthy and does not require cooking?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's just the way it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from going off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even divorced the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But she says he picked her up, not the other way around.
They are the centre of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
The singer continues what neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Either those who are not interested at all and it jumps out at them even from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were a good match, or you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's great, that's what you want, Dara complains.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but have only been legally married for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are only human, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to take a look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and in that direction is fine, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can help with Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
To me, this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite all right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it themselves or let them follow the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to dominate a part of education just because they can add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such an assertion loses some of its weight when it is made by a man who, two days earlier, said this about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue in the town square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than Odrysian?
Oops: someone has already figured it out for you.
Check out the comment with Φ<unk>ΛH
Politicians do not even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than the fact that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important documents to be approved are examined word for word, for which a basic knowledge of English is not enough anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with the English language, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm completely fine.
I often leave work at 10pm and it's never a problem.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Romani population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't:D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreaths, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath a long time ago and I'm sure Lucie has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucía, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to talk to, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana and singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that very clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know of any other agency that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so the fire brigade alone and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is down to previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not just be a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and smaller amounts of precipitation are also recorded in places where there has not been a shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the way we manage the land also amplifies the impacts.
What should we prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
It's true, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also total nonsense.
And whether you're a hockey team called "Russia the Bear" or "China the Llama," losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different from when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear from Czech commentators, what they pick out, what the referees notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it would be business as usual, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost last year" vs "we won."
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The number of confirmed cases over the past 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1,967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 over the past week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It's the lowest daily total since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain's Health Protection Agency, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the fact that the quiz took place "virtually," on a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's UK editor: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can they be expected to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit itself, and does other tricks, big and small.
The latest one is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to funnel voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at the age of 14, my parents - my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was terribly angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they gave me a good spanking, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight a lot when I was little, now I at least hit something to discharge my anger, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get punched in the mouth too much), so it's never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my children and do the same.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply fucks something up, it is probably impossible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of such quality pussies.
Otherwise, I would like to know whether you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have enough to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia take the trial of Kuciak's killers?
The main hearing in the trial of four people accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman, Marian Kočner, and his connections to the top echelons of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they allowed themselves to be fooled, and society paid the price.
Just six months ago, people were dying of Covid on Czech television.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on a repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The municipalities criticise the draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Authority to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted project proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not really have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in certain licensing procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A possible lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-governments, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorization of the repository, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for this work amounts to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only deferred to their successors the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against the Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared off by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new physique in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large frame was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, for example, or a university text, I would probably be looking for how to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the lord / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not face them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is simply not possible to translate "boss" in a general, one-word way; Czech and other languages do not solve this problem in any way (only Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is, in short, for the story or the game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
They have been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
It is also helping the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
A declared search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
He described her as being 5'10" (168cm) tall, thin with brown eyes and long straight hair the same colour.
It should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are concerned for her as it is unusual for her to go missing
Local MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She took part in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
However, it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorised by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
We noticed a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
For the time being, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its title, this time it was marked as "Copy of correction of receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as the e-mail clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic over the past few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sectors of the population has led to them finding common ground.
The anti-vaxxers, anti-whistle-blowers and co. alone would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy in Reverse.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose vaccine.
It won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which mankind is justly proud.
No more stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power, were unable to come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" shot footage has become a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been sought by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer and an MP representing the part of London where she lived are also appealing for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
The Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person as infringing copyright with her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that Krteček's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a manhole without a cover.
Lives were at stake.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation."
The great return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalie for Litvinov, Plzen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL this October.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on NHL ice since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalie was moving from one stick to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning U.S. time, where he played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he posted a 94.5% save percentage.
The Pilsen-born hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had problems with his hips last year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "The Frenchman" has played 36 games and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also posted his wish, using a photo of him helping his daughter Camille put on a veil at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, associates and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not specify who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The image, which serves as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot Racecourse in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face veil, helps Camilla put on her veil colour-coordinated with her bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in a current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was promised CZK 1 million by Prague-based Slavia for the 2018/19 league title.
The server efotbal.cz reported this, adding that it had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, said that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt acts.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, which mainly feature Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berber a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia's chairman Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdik.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer in any of football's positions.
Like former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, he was released from custody in mid-January.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the cold war.
The guns will be new, but basically of an inferior type (gunners have to get out of armored cabs and carry rounds by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent but at the end of their lease, transport- too small with short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we have none at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
SAMs: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have this story.
I have a chase right next to town.
There were nutria coming out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I went there to sit.
When I walked in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came up, but sure enough, a fox went after a while.
I let it come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got down from my perch he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has these days.
So get somewhere visible, put your expensive stuff in a sleeping bag at your feet and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry got the respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of respirators, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases made by each ministry and found that in a single day the amounts spent on respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which ministries behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We don't even have large stores of equipment for the trained to seize, we don't really have modern equipment even for existing professionals, plus modern equipment is getting more complex so the skills of reservists will rapidly diminish over time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts where anyone can deploy them will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla, and a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The only time we will fight on Czech territory is in a conflict of this scale and intensity, where a gerilla is irrelevant, and we don't even have the geography to do so.
We mainly don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then you watch a guy who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago go on the offensive alone between 2 or 3 Swiss and go, "what do you think is gonna happen now?"
Well, of course he's gonna get taken for the average taxpayer.
The "bring on the defender" situation is so horrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our striker managed to outrun one opposing player.
The first swallows
Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the next weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time and, as is well known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it may cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired through previous exposure to the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon also entered the covida equation this week on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And it is soon to be complemented by Pfizer's paxlovide, which reports a success rate of 85 per cent so far.
But the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company also ended up on the tape first because the drug began development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease in horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
In contrast, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without hesitation that they do not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Ono in France alone Le Pen and Zemmour, both polling over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where what is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want nuclear warheads on their own territory, either for security reasons or the speed of warhead deployment due to the more westerly location.
Those underground shelters ( there are two in each maple tree) only held warheads not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy that weapon, a special unit came and retrieved that warhead and mounted it on some sort of launcher.
Except for the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate condition.
In the second grade of primary school we had a classmate who was a gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain things, he missed little, came regularly, played sports with us, didn't steal lunches or phones, came cleanly dressed.
He also went to outdoor schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, his siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, threatening and menacing the other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something on an advert (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and have often sold to gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes along, reaches out, trashes apartments and houses, just messes around, makes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, they're going to bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, went into the opposite direction at a curve.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being freed, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted in a stable condition to the hospital in České Budějovice, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU parcels, customers often fail to provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and give the post office his customs details.
He receives an email telling him that customs is expecting a package to arrive.
He then just needs to fill in the details of the parcel and if the trader has not already included VAT in the sale, customs will charge it on the total amount of the parcel and the shipping costs.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
But not all deliveries go smoothly.
Because of new customs rules, the number of daily shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests to provide the information needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
For example, we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and petrol, do you think this is the way to go?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
For example, how much of a raise did you get (who is an employee)?
I got a 2% gross raise this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are only put behind bars for even 6 months?
This just boggles my mind, how the court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victim reporting?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He called them to her himself.
But he took a roundabout way of doing it.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers, after calling the emergency number, reached the spot and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made it all up so that the officers would come to the spot.
In reality, he only wanted the officers to advise him on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
On checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, under a nationwide search, and had a warrant out for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not Slavic ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme of course, too bad Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague for the US :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
I personally wouldn't consider such a case to be a true belief.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose then?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
After all, even the Ten Commandments say there is no god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed will send me to hell or some such place for it?
Other: voluntary training followed by inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one does well one can get a pro offer.
All branches of the Army could use something like that.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: There is constant mention of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only when we grow up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
There should be a similar blending between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is trouble.
Oh, my goodness.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proven that all they have to do is show their backs and they'll take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long run as a guarantor of independence is an armed to the teeth army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.
And every teenager today can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what's not to like.
We don't need border fortifications, that's shit today, but a pimply teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in the box tsunami
Unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home overwhelmed with boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is once again being used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to a participating shop (the KAMsNIM.cz map contains nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overflowing blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the money saved, as packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% in recent years.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, this also strengthens their brand.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use all of them for packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the app www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, old electrics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
This way, all the rubbish can end up in the right place, plus reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
"It gradually adds collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron's presentation of the priorities of the French EU presidency - starting in January - before the weekend was spectacular.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they are impossible to do in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And France will hold new head of state elections in April.
The electoral calendar has affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is more concerned to prevent history being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is now going around France saying that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and ignore what's going on in France.
Wouldn't there be a need for one?
Students in European countries are often taught history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated who in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The story, which harkens back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for directing and best actress for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it topped the audience rankings.
Best Actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the regular flu, it was worse.
I don't get diarrhea with the flu.
(Just a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, to be published on December 20, will include the traditional literary supplement.
And along with it will come cultural tips.
We are enclosing the book ones for you, the subscribers, in addition to this digital edition, so that you will have enough time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from a previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another serving of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with unusual poetic insight, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose work, photographer Šesták has attempted to capture the essence of small towns and Czech society.
It is a story about a return to one's roots, which turns out to be a longed-for illusion.
The bohemian and comparatist translates the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her rendition surpasses the folk versions in brutality and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental tale of return from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Trains are starting to run according to a new timetable, and in some places the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains on the railway will start running according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route will be slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, ČD plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections daily, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also see the railways running services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will be replaced by ČD here after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily services on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change trains on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of ČD.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare.
As with ČD, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil and die.
I've never in my life heard teaching from the slave party's perspective or from that time, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
No one teaches you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, right in the schools, both the more northern schools and the southern schools.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happening before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are pretty taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to pass judgement without the perspective of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good accomplishments of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things went against them too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out some facts, lie and manipulate, plus for example our perspective doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT where they shut down someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, those students were pretty radicalized and the schools encouraged them in so many ways.
And to think that these people are going to be a lot older someday, it makes me a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it should have and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's become radicalised.
Nowadays, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are labelled as feminists, so are other groups like LGBT, and it leads to radicalisation on the other side too, where it often leads to resistance even on quite sensible things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Plus, I find the concept of nationality in general to be useless in terms of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people it is interests, world views and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovakian parish priest is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always yells some bullshit about the coronavirus that puts everyone to shame.
Then of course there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic Modernism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to services with the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square is under the Dominicans and they even do a Mass there every Sunday at 3:00 pm in Latin, like they did before Vatican II.
The crib from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flamingo lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna to get it this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Breclav.
They also took it at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts take the train to Vienna to collect it.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, 18 December, by Scout couriers who will travel on selected express and passenger trains.
Local Scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations and will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
Also this year, the Scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We are giving recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear veils, of course, try to keep the spacing as low as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and tranquillity along with the flame.
For believers, the Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can pick up the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the basic economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology(e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and it crashes the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-funded by xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when that company is somehow holding on and taking contracts/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's demise
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught in a trick or trap too - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I still catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always avoid it.
That's also why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all crap, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internets.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in) point 1:
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is cryptic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has bucked the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Movie theaters, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, premiering a record-breaking two hundred-plus of them to their audiences this year.
The operator of the IMDb movie database has done the math.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring points with audiences in recent years and has seen a significant increase in viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
Four times more Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb only includes in its total those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with the season, while popular films worldwide include Home Alone, Love in Heaven and the 1946 classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful.
However, the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special series of films, the BBC reminded.
Its Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers in on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter that much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"It's a form of escape for the audience and a way to feel a little bit of peace, at least for two hours, in the midst of all the holiday madness and craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
He said Hallmark Television, for example, uses the same formula for its films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about a half hour before the end, but it's resolved and the two kiss.
It's like that over and over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not be involved in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for covid-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place that he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of Haas will not be racing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from last place and Max Verstappen from first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and showing no symptoms, according to a statement from the Haas stable.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
That's because any replacement would have to complete qualifying or drive in another part of the weekend.
The first driver is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for covid-19 at the start of the season just ending, and last year Sergio Pérez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And nobody will give a shit that the boss said
Legally, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
In the same category as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.

(3) The offender shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years to ten years if, by the act referred to in subsection (1), he causes serious bodily injury to at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph (1).

"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his piece over six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds softness to the sweater," the designer praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The engineers, scouts and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish counterparts protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in the wake of months of action by the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with the false promise of easy crossings of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Omikron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspected variant reported in another child from Adamov, from a preparatory class.
There is no direct contact with the previous cases from the Adamov primary school," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that the cases are two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of the cases have mild symptoms and four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of having Omicron has travelled abroad
None of the people mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had there been any contact with anyone abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championships for any of those named, Ciupek said.
Earlier, chief sanitary officer Pavla Svrčinová said the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
Players from South Africa were there and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict arms sales.
It wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court opinion upholding Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
But the court was now deciding not the constitutionality of the entire law, but a technical question arising from the measure's innovative design.
Indeed, the enforcement of the ban in this case was delegated to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in the usual court of law.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to stand, and largely endorsed Texas' maneuver to protect its law," California Gov.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would empower members of the public to enforce bans on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is a term for homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (more than CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits to make them.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said California Gov.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban here in June as unconstitutional.
If the state were now to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against extending that legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where they gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also make improvements to the vaccines themselves based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, there will be a vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to be on the market shortly, and according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
Ziobro said the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw down €36 billion from the EU's fund to rebuild economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also reconsider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on rule by the most powerful and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would result in a reduction of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
But to know herself... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yoghurt more than once too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they had all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If there's an avoidance, I won't even go to any market anymore, no action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
Lidl to take my holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
I've watched two years of data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little more out of touch than most vaccine advocates.

Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day, y'all.
I was punished with a boil when I was a kid.
It was never for grades, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the cooker and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a couple of whacks on my bottom (through my clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishment (when done reasonably and in moderation) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than words.
I think the warning part is important, because in a way it gives the child the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting the punishment.
For me, in the end, mostly just the warning was enough to get me to listen.
Defending the system
In 1999, when Vojtěch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document sworn to and taught at school, or an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he was strongly inclined towards the former.
Once we have agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a country and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like Czechs like pork and cabbage dumplings, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its authors (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example with the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies across history have faced.
A constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians their power.
Covid does not choose, in the Brno hospital they are fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novosti.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, and often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," Dominik said.
The doctor said there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place in the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
The really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ARU.
Children with post-coronary syndromes have been on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adolescents as well as several-month-old babies, in addition to adults.
Hospitals are also seeing children in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, we have children of several months and adolescent age lying in our hospital," the chief minister said.
However, he is happy that the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths due to coronavirus.
According to available data, as of 6 December, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward - the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part.
He also points out that, as in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-coronary syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You can't ski/bike in the woods outside of marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not policed that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor practice?

As a singer he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He has worked with the Hradec Krkonoše Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to contain a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are vying for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping fight the coronavirus in many places, including in hardest-hit Italy.
What is the perception of Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of a friend meets a friend of a friend and says, hey, you want an elephant?
I got one and it's awesome.
My wife likes it because it cuts the grass, washes the car with its trunk, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
I'll sell you an elephant for 5,000 if you want.
Friend: All right, let's high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: "Dude, what kind of elephant did you sell????
The lawn's trashed, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's trashed, the kids are scared of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says: you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, this is working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century the mood will be different and it will happen.
I thought of that too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm being wordy.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that the American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect it's already included in that broad term and there's no need to specify further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just being wordy :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical requirement

Britain's Vicki Holland tortures Milly the cosmos monkey
Horrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down the toilet and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, with no regard for its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified cosman.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon again.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and ordered to pay an estimated £12,000 in court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
For a long time the monkey refused even to eat.
Even now that she is settled and comfortable with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will always follow her, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat on drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than £50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
How do you take away the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, with honourable exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
As long as you get an A on the test and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't bat an eyelash and tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning it for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't have the need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of the reason it's taught is for the many people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all that stuff to stand at the machine, I was totally serious... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elite probably plays a part in this) However, the price of having barbarians standing by our machines is simply high.
If only journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these proportions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to nosy fans' probing questions about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Things have been sizzling between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move out to see her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri reacted angrily to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's now ex-wife's supposed honesty didn't sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things and we never really talked about it much in the family either.
I certainly don't want to cause any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't help it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he ended up stealing less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
He then thought of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana in the process.
When the owner of the apartment woke up the next morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The police subsequently arrested Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and tied in effect to a pandemic alert.
If it's repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections for the four municipal councils.
People voted for new councils on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected councils broke up.
A total of 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and especially the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said Eva Krumpová, the deputy chair of the CSO.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic made the elections more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
Jana Křižková, the current mayor of the municipality, who is a member of the Private Party, also won re-election to the council on their behalf.
The Komňans - independent candidates won one seat on the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovná association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the re-run elections in Lužice in Most.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came second, with 43.27 per cent of voters giving it their vote, so it will have three representatives on the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves won the elections in Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, winning one more seat and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff people write here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic standpoint (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I do mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, like the 30 years
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have no business together
The man fell upside down from 12 metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived the incredible fall on Sunday night, with the help of rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Workers at the regional operations centre received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ambulance crews - medical and paramedic - immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and landed head first on concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should have, and the fire brigade went into action.
By the time the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma centre for further care, informed the spokesman of the MS Region's Emergency Medical Service, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line in the fight against the disease is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Rezac.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends his belt
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
For things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found an opponent in seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira didn't falter, showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a win, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
It came in the women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "midget", because Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not going to be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with an arm bar herself.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents graced each other with plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena took Nunes to the ground where she began to choke her out.
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Although Poirier fared better at first, the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, as he tried to hit his opponent with an arm bar.
He was not very successful, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of shots.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost for the first time in two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph by landing a hard right hand on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of accurately aimed punches to record his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to get the better of Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now losing for the first time in seven years.
The hip or the hip?
On the face of it, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it's no problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in their uncloned form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "hip" are both masculine and feminine, the former inflected according to the pattern "machine", the latter according to the pattern "song".
Another group of nouns have different forms in the first singular case, for example, "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are spelled the same way, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, as are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some of the words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-cloned, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the word 'image', which is both masculine and feminine, or the word 'bufet', which has remained uncloned in the middle gender but has masculine endings like 'hrad'.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped obstructing them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, now in their fourth month in Australia, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impact, as critics claim?
And what will the country need to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to lock it away.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I do know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how those people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting and a spit in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is awash with half-built houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
This is because they do not have the funds to finish their houses under construction and banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also rising.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses they have already built.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people are moving into unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year and fifty percent of them have been built.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are making no profit," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to experience financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house to cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň said.
Of the materials, copper and iron have become the most expensive, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction firms are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and a pandemic is holding back the influx of foreign workers.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But real visions are missing, says ČRO commentator - mujRozhlas
Apart from the traditional celebrations, the entry into the New Year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
As in, I find the thesis great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The internship is totally fine here, unless you are a total macaque and have something left in your head, the committee won't choke you on theory unnecessarily.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam and when I was stumped, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I got right away and I got it right.
Otherwise, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do their term project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course that incorporates the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defense.
All ok but don't flood the emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, otherwise something might happen to them.
But you might as well put a statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it so that he's grabbing Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing sticks at artists.
Once you don't put up stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether to like, comment or save.
It's pissing me off terribly lately, so I may have to downgrade to tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my industry have success and barely give a shit.
Eventually I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Donbass Workers' Party
Union - yes, break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Belovezhskaya Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open acquiescence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with a population of almost three hundred million.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has shrunk by ten to eleven million.
Even ignoring the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They have deliberately deindustrialised, put the brakes on agriculture, severed from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a 'power vacuum'.
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day, mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs CZK 189 per kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain discounts it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take things like this to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like, it was good stuff, full of completely unnecessary lectures about how I should wash and not be a pussy.
It's a shame about the paper, they wouldn't have to cut down the forests for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail gets you to comply because you like the person without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd break down in tears and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she went nuts.
Then I ended the relationship, telling her I was breaking up and insisting that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from having another fit.
A man like that sucks the feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better to keep your distance
when insurance companies are rampantly ripping off people who wouldn't even know about this horrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we accomplish is complications for companies, carriers and others because of their employees getting five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the west, they've stopped the shenanigans and recognised that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal some more and fuel his ego by inventing faggotry.
I see we're getting the good old scumbag back again.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this crooked business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight again.
I was one of the recruiters, I gave it a try (I was 20 years old, freshman in college), the initial promises of product and sales skills training quickly morphed into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering as I wanted to help people, however the training was more on how to scare and talk people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to pitch a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made you feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every tip and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't stick their noses in our business.
So regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form it's done here it's quite good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, etc.
Company events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a kind of almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us too much as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Jakub Kulhánek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the resignation, announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon the British police confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
In respect of the family, we will not give any more information on the case.
Our condolences, Kulhánek tweeted.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before she was due to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
London police subsequently launched a manhunt for her, with Interpol listing her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police had already arrested a man in this connection a few days earlier.
However, it did not disclose what role he was supposed to have played in the case and what it suspects him of.
Four municipalities gifted themselves new councils towards the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region elected new councils.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils broke up.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men ran for 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
On Monday, the results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went off without a hitch.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of much of the population at all levels of the population is something I still have a problem with.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He'd be stripped of the presidency and eligibility to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are very slim as others here mention.
Plus, I'm not sure if the mapping of the dossier could even be considered treason.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who go without sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who are sex-abstainers rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women aged between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networking sites and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged between 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriages, with only 5% saying they had gone without sex in the past year in 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%. Stone added that married people under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religiosity also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided in their opinion of premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the prevalence of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on especially during the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of mandating vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a section of the population to engage in behaviour that they do not want but which could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and one on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be to blame for the death of an eighty year old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some misinformation, and as a result didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a die-hard opponent of vaccination, who is here shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
A snow-free Czech Republic.
How will a mild winter play into the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent memory in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizera 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it is not about the pan-bikers.
Once in high school, a teacher took us across town to the boathouse so we could ride boats on the river.
On the way there, we walked down this one fairly wide street and who do we see in the middle - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily I ran away, but they got into a fight with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are very spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already breaking down, says Orozovic
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor said the crisis, triggered by worrying Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as night after night we see hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene after a while, but another nun was driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her licence for failing to yield the right of way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle had been hit by another nun who had asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her driver's license after finding that she had over two milligrams of alcohol in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
But Juraj Šajmovič has not protected his film.
Czech family comedy filmmakers have looked to American stories about pet dogs.
But in doing so, they forgot one important thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitsch film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People How to Live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. is loosely following his previous film, Here I Watch, from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some familiar characters return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Sumava guesthouse, which is failing and so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmović (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the narrative techniques in their previous dog film, but there at least the children and the dog had fun.
This time, the creative duo have written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the darker delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates specify - on the hood of a car or a church steeple (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), Mojmír, a retired colonel, despite his years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken by her family to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude with a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing healing of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed to convey this message.
A pair of female staff thieves, a dog-walking contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs the fertilising power of bone meal - which the drunken family at the guesthouse, of course, get drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and sits, toned and made-up, with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flakka as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmakers explain to the viewer that "sometimes that happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and punchline, and directorial direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parts, they don't have much to play.
The only positive point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a couple of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters commit.
Nor is years of membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer - an argument.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and human-dog friendship, there must be a knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and minimal sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from exactly the kind of morons you are.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here it's obvious you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to these kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore more of an exception.
That's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas setting, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests that are at stake, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall," predicted Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tankers on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders are up seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," reported tanker driver Imad Suleiman in September.
Clashes have erupted between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely without water.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said that talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington that preparations were under way for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is staying in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a news conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
I eventually found out that my suspicions of a pyramid scheme were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with more doubts and questions for a while and finally said thank you and left.
Call me a punk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers hit the mountains this weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people hit the cross-country trails and the slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were favoured by the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Jested Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the period after contracting covid-19.
René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales shops are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokisova from Skiopava in Opava.
She expects more traffic during ski courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of Snowbear in Hradec Kralove, also feels that there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be because of the covid.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost out of rentals.
Compared to before the pandemic, we're at about 50 percent, Shintak told the Czech News Agency.
He said people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learnt to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental shop in the Novako complex in Bozi Dar is seeing a high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested in renting skis now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
She said there is also interest in the ski school, which is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of a company really doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started because one fine day Orban won, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the elections in general.
If life is going to be bad here, some traditional V4k lunatic might as well win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on a plane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury or is it make-up for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the Lambeth police department where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the message continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who raised Srncova's case during a press conference on Saturday, is also urging the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case and he remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of doing.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approx 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers" but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to the situation in 38 is off on so many points I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, they will affect mainly suburban connections
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will have to face several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will start running on the route from Beroun to Český Brod through the Prague Central Station.
The R17 fast train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
The PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among others, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go as far as Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 runs via Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimon and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation on ten local lines in Central Bohemia has been cancelled or restricted, among others to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague is being extended, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't get any exercise after work I don't have the energy to exercise so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most pizza buns and for snack yoghurt and apple.
Question: what healthy, uncooked food would you recommend I buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you do, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the tree may be hiding under the snow.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved's relationship.
The famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She says he hit on her, not the other way around.
For three days they have been the centre of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it's jumping out of the can, or us, whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if some of you want an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or if you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved is a long-time vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They only came out now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but had only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are only human too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband too, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, just confirming that dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends within the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which I find to be the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments aren't usually advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it definitely doesn't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. are pretty bad addresses), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it's close to most of the faculties of the BUT (I don't know where exactly you're getting in).
So I've never looked for a rent, but I'm a native Brnoer, so I can possibly advise you about Brno as such, if you're still missing some information :)
But that's an example of completely "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or let them go by the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of the education system just because he throws in a few crowns on top of the full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier made such a statement about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in the town square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've experienced when cataloguing/digitising that they (even long-time professionals) either throw it away by eye somehow, or write something along the lines of xxx *** or ... (depending on convention) and put in a note that it's illegible.
Truth is, in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look in some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character to match what's physically on the coin.
P.S. Isn't that more of an Odryan empire (kingdom) than an Odryan one?
PSS: someone already broke it down for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse embarrassment than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents that are approved are examined word for word; some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relations.
Plus, it's quite interesting about the English language, after the UK left the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceylon.
This is my third year working there and I'm totally fine.
Many times I drive from work I 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has hardly set foot there in his life can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
Plenty of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
Most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath on Sunday, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annika, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we were still talking, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying presents all the time, and I'll definitely buy something for Dada and Lucie, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and can't afford it, so are firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is only capable of defending Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has become scarce in mountain and foothill areas, and even places where there has been no shortage of water are experiencing lower rainfall.
Climate change is the cause of the drought affecting much of central Europe.
But the way we manage our land is also adding to the impact.
What can we do to prepare for drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it's gonna be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know shit about playing hockey, and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total dud too.
And whether you're hockey team is "bear Russia" or "lame China" losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than being tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators nitpicking what referees don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it's like any other time, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than they've won, I guess it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily count since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospital admissions occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour boss Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz by saying that it was conducted "virtually", via computer.
However, it was attended by groups of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV's commercial television in Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can it be expected to be?
It will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies in order to profit from this, and does other tricks of a greater or lesser degree.
The latest one so far is that, in practice, everyone can vote where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition might succeed.
So just to reiterate, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether they would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and seats will be won by a united opposition.
This is a great unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play even harder in their bid to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new developments.
It all starts with the language.
I've been beaten up quite a lot, last time I was 14, my mum's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has for a long time but then bangs her extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I'm very choleric and used to rage terribly as a kid, to the point where I'd lie on the floor in convulsions and be all blue, I was probably taken to the shower twice to calm myself down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, when I was a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I'll at least punch something to get it out, and when I was younger I'd slap my parents on the arm like that (so I wouldn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it too.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just plain wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that point when it was no longer "parenting," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, I guess it's impossible not to screw up your kids at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not worried about loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you having the money to pay the mortgage?
Kocner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia's trial of journalist Kuciak's killers go?
The main trial in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová has begun in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It has stirred civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
The press are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition got orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and the company bounced back.
On Czech television, people were dying with covid just six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on municipal involvement in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste is still not in place.
The government's Legislative Council has suspended consideration of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities concerned, which are associated in the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments are expecting from the law a significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the repository site is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will proceed at all at a given site.
This can be ensured by obliging the Repository Authority to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposal for a substantive plan almost completely disregards public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
Under today's legal standards, municipal representatives realistically have few options to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a repository site.
They can only comment or appeal in certain permitting procedures, but the authority or minister whose interests are at stake decides.
Any appeal has no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of local authorities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly applied in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as Sweden and Finland.
Moreover, the drafting of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for this work is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage said: After the industry ministers, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We offer a helping hand in this regard.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of the lack of municipal rights in such a crucial construction project in a similar way to the municipalities directly affected in the selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep-Sea Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that is not limited to deep-sea repositories.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was finally scared off by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new figure at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I used to put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in a 2018 interview.
This time, I wanted to take it slow.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects a gaming reader, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, for example, and maybe a college text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that don't need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life where there are bosses but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably not possible to translate a boss in one word, English and other languages don't solve it (interestingly, only Catalan translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply an important for the story or the game in general, computer-controlled adversary stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
The Czech police have also joined the search.
The police have been searching for the 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since 7 December.
The British police are also assisting the British police through Interpol.
The Czech woman Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular about her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are cooperating closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
It said she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She is believed to be from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP Harriet Harman has joined the search for Petra.
She has been involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are very worried about her," she told a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorising the Czech Republic in the run-up to Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight drop in attack campaigns, attacks picked up significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We saw a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeting the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's malicious attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was labeled as Copy of corrected invoice for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in late August and early September, and with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, attacker activity is on the rise again.
The Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists intercepted campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
Attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt also continued to appear.
An attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and suppression of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demos of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media is reporting.
From the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That is to say, a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find common ground.
Anti-vaxxers, anti-Russians and others alone could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are on the rise in popularity, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy turned inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be birthed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money coming in, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-plus-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left or center movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we are going to have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action by scientists of which humanity is justly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister who is advocating change
Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev has tasked Kirill Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties, which claim to fight graft and abuse of power, failed to reach an agreement, leading to two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived have been calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court ruled that the paintings of the Mole in the rooms in Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a manhole cover had been gaping for a month.
A life was at stake.
The municipality referred complaints to the Regional Directorate of Transport, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gap.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "address the situation intensively".
The big return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Frenchz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Frenchz, who has been going through a difficult time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the turn and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk got injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas he alternated, and as of this time he has not yet presented himself on the NHL rinks.
The incident happened at the moment the experienced goalkeeper was shifting from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Frenchman will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in his lower body,” announced the entirety from Denver in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he credited 94,5% of interventions.
The breeding of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL “Francík” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92,3%.
Charles puts on Camille's drape at Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate selected a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, who used a photograph showing his consort Camille at horse races helping to put on a drape.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
Photography originated somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki-coloured summer dress, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, nor is it clear exactly when it originated.
Last year, for a photograph intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their country mansion in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at horse racing in Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat on his head and a drape on his face, helps Camille put on her colour-matched drape with the bright dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague — Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised one million crowns from Slavia in Prague league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about this, saying that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice Club, stated that the red-white men did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan Nesmar, who finished at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is in the case also among the accused.
The CSI allegedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward for when he got his degree.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the First League title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to have promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha from the officials of SK Slavia Prague, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nesmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer implies whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The contestant denied any corruption conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the proportions in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed unlawful conduct, sought to influence referees in breach of fair play rules and have not granted any financial performance to anyone in this context,” it said Told for List Messages.
In intercepts, among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's dark-skinned former players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was unleashed by a police crackdown in several places including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR last mid-October.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of football's functions.
In mid-January, he, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen must from the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
Honitbu's right next to town.
They were climbing nutria out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the river bank.
I didn't want to mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course a fox went in a while.
I let her come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
Poor fisherman nearly shat himself, waved his headband on all sides, so I called out to him it was on fox.
Before I got out of the sit-down, he was down.
I.e. I meadow man be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably see in the thermal imaging that almost everyone is today.
So in a visible place, dear stuff you dat to noham in the spacak and you should be fine with your apartment.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Intraro got hold of respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy the runway?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were done by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be taken up by training, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover modern technology is still more complex, so The skills of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to practice someone again.
And in the end, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it goes to lead a mass gerilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to remove the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where geril will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography for this.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they have one.
Then there is such a situation that you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes back, goes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 swiss and you're like “tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?”.
Well, of course they're gonna make him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this “flood your defender” skill is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one player of the opponent.
First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting some major reversal for the weeks ahead.
The onslaught in hospitals according to statistical models will last some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known, the omikron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to which vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease helps against it.
But this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 per cent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the incoming medicines is here administration ready.
As it was said, Merck's molnupiravir reaches domestic patients first.
The company ended up on tape first even because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatments for equine viral disease in South America of the continent.
What's often neglected with this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking “how our beak grew.”
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you that no.
In the West they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist crap.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
Afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they actually find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the spin of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory whether for safety or the speed of deployment of warheads because of a more westerly position.
In those underground enclosures (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rocket as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived and retrieved this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, there are those left in a desolate state.
At the second level of primary school we had a classmate of Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to make a light, missed a little, went regularly, did sports with us, did not steal snacks, or phones, walked cleanly clad.
He went to schools in nature, did various monkey shops, but he was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings joined, cigans to the same grade, different grades.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, often dealt with something by the police there, threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sell sometimes something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I sold often to Ciganas, money always had, did not try to make any attempts to stretch me on price, communication in tranquility.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month saying he had already rewritten it on himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise as long as they behave the way they belong in a decent society (works, works, doesn't beat women, simply common behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, outlets apartments and houses, he just has a mess around him, makes trouble.. so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs too.
Young woman died in car crash on Prachatick
“The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene,” Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unidentified reasons, drove out in a bend into the opposite direction.
After colliding with Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the roadway, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the crash.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his discharge, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported to the hospital in České Budějovice by air, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a lighter chest injury and was rushed to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often fail to supply details about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly acquires collectible cards.
“Typically, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly expensive, and now he has to add VAT and the post office hand over the data to the customs procedure.
An email arrives to him, telling him that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the sale, the customs office will rate it out of the total amount for the consignment and transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments manage to deliver smoothly, though.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad decreased from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30 thousand shipments in the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data needed and filled them in on time, we would be about half of it here, says Matyáš Vitík, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should be doing to slow, or compensate for that growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it rushes?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford regular things, mainly energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I got added 2% in gross this year, which is a travesty, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists put themselves behind bars for maybe only 6 months?
This just doesn't take away my head, how a court can only send an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for a few years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And that's not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
Grave man 'burnt' his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The Grave man inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her himself.
But he went a round of it.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not enough to wonder when the alleged “robbed” told them that he had made everything up to allow officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the constables on how to file the notification to the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discover that the woman is on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant is placed on her.
The case is therefore handled by the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally Slavs since, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme, too bad Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well I don't know, it's quite a question whether or not a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in any of those thousands of religions that will punish you unnicely if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
So it wouldn't be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong way out of those thousands of gods and that one real god I didn't exactly hit me for this he sends to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model, I suspect, is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one would do well then he can get a pro offer.
All the files of the Czech Republic could use something like that.
You could do this in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly getting ready, companies are hunting in schools and a kind of intermingling takes place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions into employment relations.
Not only in adolescence, but this process happens constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never break in again.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and so they will defend us if we get in trouble.
Well, please the frying pan.
All it takes is one election in the US that will twist their budget and all NATO goes into a screw.
The Anglans will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown once that just show them their backs and take whatever they want.
The only thing that has been a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population who can master military equipment of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what could not be.
We don't need a border fortification, that sucks today, but the charmed teenager behind the remote control device book can do it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home wrapped with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved shop (the map of the KamsNim.cz project contains nearly 150 of them).
This will encourage small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and also the money saved, as packaging cardboard has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics, is also one such store.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who are accumulated at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular cartons.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more respectful world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generations, says Petra Lopushníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KamsNim.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, high volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would be otherwise unnecessarily become waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Utidy Czechia association.
It seems bad to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and crapproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computing skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because like Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and bend everything on one screen in the app.
Feel free to use the technique since childhood, but especially let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron set out the priorities of France's EU presidency before the weekend — starting in January — and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for Europeans to be protected — at work, on the street — and mentioned so many events that they can't be made in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and the left, agree on a few, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar affected priorities themselves as well.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe”, and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed criticisms that Macron was about pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, it's trying to defend the rewriting of history.
Far-right candidate for French president Éric Zemmour is hugging France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime that collapsed with Hitler in World War II wasn't so bad, and has quite a bit of success with that with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries learn history as an us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech “Mice” did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for director and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held on to the first rungs of the audience chart.
The best actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like “having the flu/being stuffed” I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to regular flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't say everyone has it that way)

Trains start running according to new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure is adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales started by carriers already during the fall.
Czech Railways plans to make an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Runways alongside domestic connections under the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The firm will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains of the carrier will travel in North Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Runways factor inflation into their fares annually.
The biggest change in the timetable of the RegioJET is the entrance to line R23 Ústí nad Labem — Mělník — Nymburk — Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will make a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return services to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar travel times of its long-distance trains as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arrivy trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the single rail fare for the second year running.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to nap, dying.
I haven't heard teaching in my life from the perspective of the slave party or from that era, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
Nobody even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
Nobody will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I spent some time in the US too, right in schools, both in the more northern schools and the Southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately obfuscating the facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (like in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more likely that history isn't black and white, and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way while we're at those Southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand they too had some good successes and I found it absurd to repudding them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better, as enough people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was slave owners, and a lot of things went wrong with them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view doesn't exist (there was a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalised and those schools supported them in it as many times.
And if I imagine these people are going to be a lot older someday, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the vote of the majority, because among the young it is and in the ruling elite as well.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it's not about the same anymore, it's radicalized.
At present, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological fact, so other groups like LGBT and it leads to radicalization even to the opposite side where it often leads to a backlash even for pretty reasonable things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more likely to encounter the wrong geography, that was but ambidextroduct:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because that, I think, is completely groundless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, I find the concept of nationality overall useless in terms of some personal identity.
If something has me with people, interests, worldviews and common experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is an awfully fine guy, he has a sermon more about theology than politics, but then he always discards some cocootine about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services to the Hussites because it's a lot like theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michala in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00pm they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav — Plamínek sparked in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna because of the coronavirus pandemic, but even this time they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal — Břeclav.
They took it on the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the troop and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, Scout Amalie Budíková told the journalists present.
Whereas last year the transfer took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing Reintal — Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually for him, though, scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes about the delivery of flame around the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the Scouts traditionally travelled by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday 18 December by scout couriers who will travel by selected speeders and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in stations, who will then continue to spread flames around the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going on similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events, to wear drape, of course, try to observe spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave In order to make it as safe as possible, the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light Action, Zuzana Hrbková, described.
The tradition of Bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies overall.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it hacks the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I work in a factory where there are a million “xy funded/co-financed by project xy” message boards in the corridors, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a brake on development when this company both sticks and takes orders/employees to companies that could grow and be after its demise more productive
Total consent, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet era also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads don't move with me, but then I catch on anyway, that they also affected me - it's just so messed up that a person doesn't always resist it.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of a classic - I would ban those internets.

2. “I won't believe everything the media says”
3. “I don't trust politicians”
TVs have plummeted the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles — Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, giving their viewers a premiere this year will present a record of more than two hundred.
It was calculated by movie database operator IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring in the audience in recent years and significantly increases viewership, therefore more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films have been made this year than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be much more holiday movies in real life.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period; globally popular are also the films Home Alone, Love Heavenly or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom in Christmas pictures kicked off only in 2009, when the US cable TV station Hallmark came with a special film series, recalled the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
“In this magical period, the story does not matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies).
'For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way for at least two hours to feel a bit of peace amid all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years, 'he added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for his films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people falling in love with each other, but then some misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which will be resolved and the two kiss.
It's been like this over and over, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar vibe, people watch one after another, complements Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he won't hit the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Priz after all.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, from the last rung Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will be in a direct battle for the title Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin, according to the observations of the Haas stable, is quite fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders,” its representatives for formula1.com said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A possible alternate would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not faced with the first competitor.
At the start of the just ending season Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19, last year Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn much,” admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in half a year.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
Silver stars then adorned with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has one more catch.
“I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 kronor.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Sappers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with the months long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with a false promise easy crossing of the Union border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
The Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov primary school is not proven,” Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the county in the week.
“We continue to wait for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases — it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Nonspray Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” she said headmistress.
She added that they are two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four have a symptomless course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron travelled abroad
None of those listed have travelled abroad, nor has any of their families, nor has there been contact with anyone residing abroad.
The connection with the water polo championship is none of those listed, Ciupek said.
Pavla Svrčinová, the chief hygienist, said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being checked.
Players from South Africa were also on it, and one Belgian player fell ill upon his return.
California will limit gun sales.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state with the help of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its a controversial law against abortion performed after embryo heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's opinion by the US supreme court that left the Texas abortion ban in place, even if it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US at roughly 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court now ruled not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial route.
“I am outraged by yesterday (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which authorized the retention of Texas's ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver with aim to protect his law,” the California governor stated.
“If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work, in conjunction with the state parliament and the justice minister, on a measure that would entitle representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made guns that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to require at least $10,000 (over $220,000) in compensation and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell in California assault rifles, components to “ghost weapons” or kits for their manufacture.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do,” the California governor stated.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some Army-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state now actually reinstates the ban using a Texas template, the words of liberal supreme court member Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday would be confirmed The majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas's abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where we gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect mentioned by you.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, only it's too soon for that time.
Another fact is that in not long a new vaccine should come to the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x more efficiency.
The amount of curriculum calmly leave.
But rethink the CO is learning.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology has progressed a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into workbooks doesn't make much sense anymore, and it's a waste of time.
These things could be really brutally taken away.
On the other hand, how many people drop out of elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And the other things he will necessarily need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay myself a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, the latter does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in breach of law if it used the new powers and halted the payment of money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund to rebuild economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should answer this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes it would the current government lost its tight majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from a common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes undergone by the Polish justice under Ziobrova's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is constructing “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces “political diktat carried out by blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic by control.
He said his party would never accede to such concessions to Brussels, which would see Poland's sovereignty curtailed.
“We will never agree to Poland having colony status,” he declared.
But to confess it... At our place in Lidl they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan cheese, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an evasion, I don't even smelt into any market anymore, non-action action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years watching data being treated here like manure, most vaccination opponents are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccination advocates.
Rational discussion is taking place at expert level, but only extreme views reach the public space.
Constantly wall-to-wall.
Binary considered: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states no one addresses.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon in my childhood.
It was never due to grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to bed, fighting my bro etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next “catching” of the cooktop only brought and laid so that I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I received a few bum blows (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child reacts to them far more than they do to words.
What's important, I think, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child, in a way, the choice of disobeying and getting, or getting better and the punishment won't.
In the end, most of the time all it took was a warning to start listening
Defense of the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic inquiry in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him — whether the sacred charter to which he is sworn and about which from teaching at school or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely lean to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens and, with changes, are better to conserve them.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have predicted, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be premeditated.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have met across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set politicians with the mantinels of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to give their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for life of several months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with lately.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” the chief of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty told News Brno Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is considerably simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which is what we see especially in the last period,” added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of pediatric infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are up to the ARU recently.
Children with postcovid syndromes were continuously in the department according to the doctor throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults as adolescents , as well as several months-long babies.
In hospitals there are even children in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“At present, a child of several months and adolescent age lies with us,” the chief mayor said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the Children's Hospital FN Brno so far from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years occurred in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in the children's hospital — not just the coronavirus ward — an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, the application of the vaccination dose is also recommended in children,” the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the fields).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it's not so much guarded outside national parks).
How does the conductor train?
Music goes in my head, Josef Elector laughs.
He is unsuckled by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only at the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra or the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China builds impression of managed contagion and that authoritarian regime faces crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime faces a crisis better.
China has gone on both medical and political offensives.
A couple of months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increment of infected.
Countries including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, such as in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says to him: hey don't you want an elephant?
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because he grasses the grass, the car washes with his trunk, the children play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: Okay, let's slap, that's gonna be great...
After some time, they meet and the guy who bought complains: you dude who sold that for an elephant????
Lawn unraveled, giant poop everywhere, car unraveled, kids fight him and wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold says, you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the superpowers that set the course for international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will lead.
It struck me too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'll have a word.
I'm just proceeding from the fact that the ellipsis mostly involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruit and mandarin” is no longer clear in tangerines, that they're from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads “all US forces” thus including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So, in other words, I expect that this is already covered in that broad term and there is no need to specify it further with US forces.
But again, maybe just a word of words:D
Either way, it's a meaningless requirement
A five-degree earthquake has been recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck Japan's capital Tokyo and surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were rumbling in the capital, but no damage has yet been reported.
Nor has a tsunami warning been issued, Reuters reported.
Britain's Vicki Holland tortured cosman monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed it off.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebab and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her mistreatment said they had never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now contentedly playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence at Gwent Magistrates' Court, with a suspended suspension of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay in recalculation 12,000 kroner court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further. “
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement prompted her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new humans can still create panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered terrifying footage in the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug allegations.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: “Do you want cocaine? “
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1600 (recalculated less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you take away the same things you did in 6th grade freshman year?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, where no one, honor to exceptions, cares if you know or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and on the street randomly ask people if they master to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross and tell you they're totally in the throes.
So what the hell are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't have a need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Partly it's learning for that lot of people who need that thing is going to need.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was totally serious... because you just don't need to.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past is probably involved in our country, and against the educators and elites) However, the cost of having these machines cost us barbarians is simply high.
If journalists could count, then covid probably never reached these proportions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to quit all contact and even block it on social networks.
It has been creaky between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused to do so.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hate.
It was a planned attack from you! became incensed by Kadri's turnover in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gamblering and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now-ex-wife did not appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly represent her brother.
Normally I don't comment on this sort of thing at all, and even in the family we never said much extra these things to each other.
I don't want to induce any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I like so much, they just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Qadri publicly for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we do the most needed even though, at how young an age he was.
It saddens me all the more when I have to read such false information, which is probably pretty taken out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Qadri as I, our loved ones and family stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added indefinitely.
A drunken burglar climbed down the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
His robbery quest was launched by Cao in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle in the recalculation.
After that, he could think of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene and eating a banana in the process.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The latter subsequently detained Cao Cao.
A man has confessed to drinking something alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, while drunk, he decided to plunder.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
A drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and effective bound to a pandemic emergency.
When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law admittedly limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited but not revoked.
Over 60 per cent of voters came to the four municipalities elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišťsko region, Lusatia na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberec and in Rovna na Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councillors broke up there.
There were 99 candidates running for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Deputy President of the CSO Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding on equipment as well as staffing.
In Komni na Uherskohradišťsk, Saturday's election was won by the Independent Candidates Association, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council; 18.52 percent of the electorate gave them their vote.
The former mayor of the village Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, joined the council again.
One mandate in the council was achieved by the Komňans — independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the urns.
In the village Rovná na Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Independent Candidates Association 1 and one from the Independent Candidates Association 2 joined the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia na Mosteck were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, so has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second was the candidate Municipality for the People, who gave the vote to 43.27 percent of the electorate, so there will be three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
The election in Nová Ves in Liberec was won by independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of the electorate voted for the Independent Candidates Association and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO got 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular election, gained more by mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results of the election on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger deal?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing fool so you have someone to “argue” with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not arguing that Christians are degenerates, nor do anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it was replacing, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30 year old
tl; dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was interfered by paramedics of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
County operations centre workers took over an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and medical — immediately went to the site.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that a 27-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit the concrete with his head!
It caught coal in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of emergency service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further precautions under pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to further care Ostrava Traumatology Centre, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus about inadequate responses from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are on the front line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended belt
MMA has had a great gala full of interesting results.
There were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peñova was able to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at light-heavyweight, performing a great stranglehold against Dustin Poirier and defending the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt with a first-round technical KO.
He also defeated his opponent by Sean O'Malley.
Surprises like no one expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle with each other as an imaginary “dwarf,” Nunes did not lose for seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her way to win a lot actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
However, Peñová did not allow herself to be forced into any further error and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack using a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both female opponents conceived themselves with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peñova, moreover, got Nunes to the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the effort.
Thus, the American woman prepared everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the light-heavyweight title.
At first Poirier fared better, however, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his arm.
Although he did not succeed, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a number of wounds.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock off the stranglehold.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next bout, he scored sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right-back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
He subsequently conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most of the nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is masculine, feminine or medium.
Then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns for which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
In inflection, they then take on dual endings and in some cases remain in a non-sloping form.
For example, the words “writhing” or “hip” are both male and female, in the former they are folded according to the pattern “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For the next group of nouns, different forms are already in the first fall of the singular, such as: “row/row”, “khlrabi/khlrabna” or “potato/potato” (meaning foodstuff).
Both shapes are standard, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as “cucumber” in Bohemia and “curek” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian a pair of words: “trench” and “trench”, “donut” and “donut”, etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally non-inclined, but they gradually take over Czech endings.
Typical examples are the term “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained unbowed in the middle family, but in male it has endings according to the pattern “castle”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
Tensions are running rampant on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants attempting to get farther into Europe.
Thousands of people began making their way to the southern border of the Schengen zone after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians pledge support to Greece, humanitarian aid is also being forthcoming by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we choked, describes a Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, which Australia is dealing with for the fourth straight month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the residents themselves deal with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have been doing more to forestall the drastic fallout, critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations always have been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written everywhere.
People find it awkward to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how horribly widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people are often treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgust and spat in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “much of the accusation is fictional” and that it's a “trend” you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czechia flooding houses under construction, families have no money to finish
Prices for building material have risen more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in an awkward situation because of this.
She does not have the resources to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people don't have enough money to complete family homes already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage lending to them, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to unbuilt and uncollapsed houses.
Worse case scenario, houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent to do so,” says BHS economist Štěpán Kastecek.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of this has happened to us.
It's hard for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contracted, even though the material has gotten more healthy.
So we do without earnings,” said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on building a house to work out to five million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will be waitin',” added Slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment are the most undercut.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates from construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Hamster specified.
We're doing well and we're going to do even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the CRO — Mujrozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entrance to the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the prime minister and president of ANO, President Miloš Zeman and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Senate and the House of Representatives spoke to the nation.
What fundamental did we learn?
As in, I find my diploma super right now, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's, I always work on it all year, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The stateswoman are completely at peace with us, unless a man is a total macaque and there is something left in his head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle him on the theory.
For example, I studied at the stateswoman for a week and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical inference, which immediately came to my mind and I had it right.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do that semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they have caged.
To me, it's cool if at the end of the subject there is an exam that translates the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't get overwhelmed by emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people at the embassy might have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you might as well put up a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You should still give it to put Xi Jinping on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing performers sticks under their feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been shitting me off lately, so I might have to cut back to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my business have success and can't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even like it if something user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all creativity and energy from artists
Statement from Workers' Party in Donbasa
The union — yes, breaking — no, the opponents of breaking the USSR express their opinion in the slide.
Thirty years since the unlawful breaking of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Běominz forest on December 8, 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with open by the lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, they signed an agreement that “The SSR Union as a subject of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With one cut of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country with a population of nearly three hundred million.
With the breakup of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Běominh forest, destroyed what had been built for the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, seceded from the world's greatest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poorer of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, a series of Orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria — all the result of geopolitical surrender, surrender first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a notion in political science as a “vacuum of force.”
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that had accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken up to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it with putting it in the fridge and making it a Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will make it cheap to 99 CZK/kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat by changing its price becomes a liability for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK/kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday about 120 CZK and left it for 3 days in your fridge?
I will answer myself - I do nothing.
This crap about the fact that when something is cheap it must be guaranteed bad, spoiled or poor quality is horribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies gave out some pamphlet, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it out...
Well, the pamphlet was full of sanity and conservative views of the workings of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some such agitka.
After reading it, I found who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good stuff, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pig.
Pity the paper, because of this the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love him without realizing how much in the p*deli the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk out.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
After that, she began physically blocking the door.
It was a cool relationship for about a year but then another half year went by and started to get her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with I told her from I was breaking up and luring her but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch some amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurers are frantically shattering here by buying a cloud of tests and hounding for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees in the random number generator falling five days of house arrest.
In the west, they stopped with the crenchery, acknowledging that there was no value in tackling a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new and he has to cut some more and drive his ego by making up a faggot.
I see the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of downplaying and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelance again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the matriculated school), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly flipped into “you don't need to be interested, especially get people”.
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to frighten and talk a person.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to find a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earners, or then one felt like a peddling pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, a person learned not to jump on every spit right away and scrutinise the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even people benefit, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or “fat” account.
In the corporate where I do, I haven't experienced much of that sort of thing.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management, and they don't put our noses in anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form of what it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what is not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that someone would rate you by some numbers, and stuff like that.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments what are more “corporate”.
Sometimes one feels like we are such a skoro-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't annoy us much as long as the results are.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days British police have been searching fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December Jakub Kulhánek, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of the deaths is under investigation.
We will not be disclosing more information about the case with respect to the family.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work; she was still supposed to collect money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, London police began a search for her, Interpol ranked her among the missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already detained one man in this connection several days ago.
What role he should have played in the case and what he suspects it of, but did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councilors at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, a new council was elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberec and Rovovna na Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councillors broke up there.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 mandates in the new election.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
They registered the highest interest in Rovná municipality, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more severe epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President Czech Statistical Office.
The last voting precinct was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hrs.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Elections Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without major snags.
Coping with how idiotic a large portion of the population on all its strata is positioning themselves to this, I have a problem with that up to now.
On vaccination (tomorrow!) I'm looking forward to the most because he makes me finally less dependent on other people not being shits.
He would be deprived of the post of president and the eligibility to retake it.
But the chances of this happening are very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I'm not sure if the miscarding of a file could even be considered high treason.
High treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is a growing number of people under 35 who are sexless all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who disown sex lives rose from eight to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 years old who reported that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age reporting that they have not had sex for the previous year has grown rapidly,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people, in 2021 only 5% of them reported having been without sex for the past year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion about premarital sex divides, with about 30% of it for the wrong thing, while approx. 70% think it's okay.
“It is true that among single individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting that trend,” Stone speaks of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious establishment.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to nearly 60 per cent.
Among the “less believers,” the trend has picked up from 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” Stone claimed.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and most importantly social drinking of alcohol during pandemic times.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less likely for people out of work or lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly behind lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandating of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force some of the population into behaviors that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather tough question that I'm personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80 year old person who didn't actually know much, well we didn't explain it to him, overheard some misinformation, and as a result get inoculated didn't give and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination who rants something about bullying and a totalitarian state here alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign on fighting drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators can not do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have a story, but it's not about a little boy.
One time in high school, a teacher led us across town to a boatyard so we could ride boats down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one quite wide street and who we do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but she and a friend were talking.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
“They asked me if I said I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul,” she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way through to the boathouse.
We're terribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew into Warsaw, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint news conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it jointly clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by disturbing Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, is convenient to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group,” France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured, according to DPA, that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of runners.
Drunk Polish nuncane smacks accident, tried to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police officers told her that she could lose her driver's license for not giving precedence in driving and driving from the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle asking her for help.
The police officers then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and, after discovering she had over two promilles in her blood, promptly removed her driver's license.
At the same time, they notified her that she would be confessing from her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about dog sweethearts.
But they forgot about the essential thing: the regularities of film craft.
After the cheesy film F. Brabek Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, the next film Here We Watch Over is now in store for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-writer and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovich Jr., is a loosely follow-up to his previous film Here I Watch Me from 2012.
A talking dachshund, Hugo, and some well-known characters around him, return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is moribent, so they begin to invite the dog, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures already in the previous dog picture, but there were at least entertained children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is in the desire for a child to obscure delusions, and if the right “constellation” comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined — on the hood of the car or church tower (obviously during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), despite years of training, retired Colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, Whereupon the family is taken from the hospital so that the miraculous process of healing by the dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal darlings.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is astonished at what content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving at the show looking for “drugs” and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal — and which baked of course, the family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits ondled and made up with cigars at the family table, clamoring for her father's whiskey and slackers as a cured vegetarian, there is no laughing.
The creator will explain to the viewer that “it sometimes happens after a coma”.
Shaymovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to construct load-bearing situations, a flair for character characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are unsettled, the cut clueless and the overall impression uptight.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they do not have much to play.
The film's only feature remains poetic footage of the Šumava nature of cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzz, let alone the more folksy profanities that the characters indulge.
The argument is not even the years-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club — as in the case of Mrs Producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from exactly nerds like you.
There's a difference between bidding and forcing, here's to see how you understand the turd, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that kind of guy all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in it the case of the earnings brigade.
The Middle East has been troubled by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have noted it at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports just six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time here.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced by Nazareth resident Wasím Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the three most recent rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water landholders warned of drought long ago.
“It is to be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may wane here,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, projected in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
Tanker cars are on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Indeed, water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year my orders have soared by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years,” Imad Suleiman, a tanker car driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military crackdown on Iran
Israel's defense minister said negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and that he had briefed Washington on preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who is staying in the US, has been trying to persuade the Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are messing with them.”
About 3 years ago, this happened to me, too.
I pranked the lady a little and grilled while talking to see what she actually wanted me to do.
Eventually, I discovered that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I took the miss for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a punt, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operations due to this.
The slope has not been deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts either.
While lifters are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rentals are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the cross-country ski trails and the slopes at the weekend.
Skiers liked the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Ještěd Jakub, the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanush.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna in Šumpersk were opened.
Weekend attendance was very respectable, with an estimated 400 people arriving both Saturday and today.
Conditions are surety.
Today the sunshine was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after having had a COVID-19 disease.
With exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn skicentre told ČTK.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic are reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Interest in renting skis thankfully is.
It's not like the past years, but there are still quite a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Opava shop Skiopava.
A bigger onslaught is expected during the ski course period.
The executive director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear David Šinták feels that due to covid there is no interest in lending ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost borrowed.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
People, according to him, became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a great demand is noted by the rental company in the Novako premises on the Divine Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must already order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent cross-country skiing this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the premises.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to experience a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or doctor specialist.
Abroad are going smart and skilable people who have no assets here.
The owner of a business abroad really doesn't just leave.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orban won, reigned for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections at all.
If you live bad, then some traditional V4K freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, remain his backers and people whose possessions can't be shoved onto the plane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
In doing so, the actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it about making out for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen following her way home.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
The public is also calling for cooperation by Harriet Harman MP, who raised the Srncova case at a press conference on Saturday.
'She's been missing for days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death, 'said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman in her hand distributed by the London Police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and working here for our health service,” she stated Harman.
Police have previously detained one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of being.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine this way either.
These are not “huge amounts” but ca 8 percent of the Russian military.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted at the top.
I don't know what he made out of that Russia wanted the war.
War is one hell of an expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons to the situation in 38 are off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that to the First Punic War and the “annexation” of Sicily:D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to honor the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the “concentration” at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly touching suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, became defunct.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, speeders from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradské Město station.
In suburban train services, S7 trains run through Prague Central Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 speedtrain from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop in the recently opened station Praha-Zahradní Město.
PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will run as far as Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladoboleslavsko region will be incorporated, including overlaps to Liberec and Hradec Královéhrad regions.
At the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones introduced, and traffic will be modified on 12 functioning.
A new bus line 405 will run from Zličín in Prague, which will run all the way to Žatka.
A new direct connection Praha — Kralovice u Rakovník was also established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when express line number 404 will be newly exited.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is canceled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Praha — Beroun, Praha — Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymbursk region have been changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region are modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classically 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a short distance away to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy a maximum of pizza bun and yogurt and apple for snack.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you advise me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's the way it is unfortunately
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it destructs, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not arguing that's the only reason they forbid us to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about the relationship with Nedved: This is not what I was looking forward to
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond lives nothing more than the revelation of the relationship of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been dragging it together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she kept love from them for a long half year.
“I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who missed that Dara caught a bear, I mean sorry, Nedved,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is into the most successful Czech footballer in love with her head.
He said he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who don't care at all and pops it on them even from canned food, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are quite a good fit for each other, or insist that everyone really knows your list in detail former partners and were familiar with enlisting your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was riding for preparations for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has worked there for a long time as vice-president of Juventus football club.
With the truth out, they went only now because they were waiting for Nedjad's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
Even we are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and as he does with me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, she closed Rolins.
Hi, others commenting have probably said all the essentials already, just confirming that the dorms are super to start, my classmates mostly got to know each other during the first semester or two and they made friends and then found sublease together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise themselves very long ahead of time, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offer certainly doesn't hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), some parts of Židenice are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is nice, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where you are going exactly).
I have never wanted rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information:)
That, to me, is an example of completely “normal” reasoning, though.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own or let them go by state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will throw in a full state contribution a few crowns and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when written by a person who, two days before, had made such comments about a petitional action for boycotting a totalitarian state:
So a vote against whether someone gets an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would have consulted directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away from the eye or write something in the way xxx *** or... (by convention) and to note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd deal with it probably somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and trying student, you could look into some character databases and look up the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits with what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't that, by any chance, more like the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than Odrynian?
PSS: someone already cracked this place for you.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the “theme” of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The notion that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with that English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year and totally cool.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
Only someone who hasn't set foot in his life can say that's ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good downtown accessibility, I'd feel free to go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Daddy and mistress Gelemova like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Daddy wreath, and Lucie certainly has some, said Blesku the saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently reunited with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: BACK TOGETHER!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: BACK TOGETHER!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy Dada and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone who I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he was making that clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have both troops and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, explain that to me then?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is going to the head of previous governments, not the army, they have been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change farm subsidies, the landscape is not meant to be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought period in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreases in mountainous and submontane areas, the smaller amount of rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no emergency of moisture.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe.
The impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, I can barely keep myself in ice skates, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey, and that tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is a whole lot.
And whether you are a hockey team “copper Russia” or “llama china” so losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is matched.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators prying out, what the referees don't notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and “Italian actors” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, and that the Czech Republic lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be classic “vthey lost” vs “WE won”.
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the Czech Republic 1967, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an 'inevitable' major wave of contagion, caused by Omikron, said on television on Sunday Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviserwoman for the British Health Security Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Those infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died of omikron yet, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer found on Sunday that Boris Johnson appears to have broken the law by staging a lockdown last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned, in Downing Street Christmas quiz.
One minister in the Johnson government defended that the quiz took place “virtually,” via a computer.
However, it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the prime ministerial post.
During last December, when strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
Both the British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election overwhelmingly.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much is there to expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't like that either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voting precincts to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
That will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that fair they won't be at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be a matter of not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority as well.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big non-fuss for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in trying to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of parliament speaker and one of the leaders of Fidesz, Lászlóa Kövér, leaked to independent media outlets telling secret service chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my daddy has her long, but then she slams extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I fretted like a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was all blue, they took it under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me an educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, as a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I can at least punch into something, and as a younger one, for example, I slapped my parents on the hand (to she didn't get much through the holdout), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share of it, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn't “nurturing” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just did something Fucks up, I guess it's not possible to get your kids at least a little prick, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws are to be clear and unambiguous
So I would call Kundami those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of an income outage?
Can it really be counted on that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage out of?
Kochner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the main story begins in the trial of four defendants of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kushnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kčner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a turning point will the process mark for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it that this petition had orders of magnitude more media attention than a counter petition by the deans of all medical schools that came out a day, two later?
No, they got screwed up and the company bounced it off.
Czech television was dying with covid until half a year ago.
Another government ends and a law involving municipalities in choosing a repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law, which was intended to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in selecting and allowing deep water storage of high radioactive wastes, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government discontinued consideration of a proposal submitted to the Government after years of protractions by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law to strengthen their options more significantly when deciding on the repository that has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which the Czech atomic law and the European directive calls for.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition treaty.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which has the Platform available, concerns municipalities in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of the site for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed substantive intention proposal almost completely neglects public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in permitting procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of locating and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
Really according to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit comments or appeal, but the office or minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation shall decide.
Any action shall not have a deferential effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
Codecision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced the authorization of storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and a follow-up to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-Mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesperson of Platform Against Deep Storage said: After the Ministers of Industry who straighten the position of self-governments to the state authorities in search of a deep-sea repository of highly radioactive wastes only condemned on their successors, we are waiting for a more significant reversal from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand to this.
For our support, we also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a major construction similarly as directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The Anti-Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 societies) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-water storage.
Furthermore, the platform advocates that the decision to select the site for possible storage is subject to prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced into a slimming scare: He shed 90kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180kg, The Sun newspaper reports.
He flaunted his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
“I was poking everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can no longer afford to sit still, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends what boss and what you want to use the word “boss” in.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the “boss” is something like the master/ruler of the given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are bosses hidden (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed to beat at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where bosses are, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are mini bosses.
Ono lump in one word somehow translate boss just probably not even possible, Czech and other languages does not solve it somehow (interesting is only Catalan, which bosse translates as final adversary).
It is in short for a story or game in general significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7.
Throughout Interpol at the same time, he helps British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is on the search for Petra.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
“We share information with each other about the case,” she added.
The search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, is skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She became involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
“We have huge concerns about her,” she said at a Saturday news conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already detained one suspect.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October pointed to a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are purposefully aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is intended to arouse attention in the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous appendix had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11, 2021... exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, Formbook spyware remained active as well.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November picked up rather campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks ran continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook included most often an attachment with the extension .exe, which carried the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which was behind 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
That demos of smarts today who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to footage of the parade down the embankment and in my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimate of around 10 thousand people.
People in the parade filled both the waterfront and the bridge and the opposing riverfront road.
That means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of about four thousand protesters.
I argue that something new is born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-gappers and Co. couldn't fill or pay for this big parade.
The actions of the Chcípled Dog Association have an upward popularity, reminds me of A Million Misters for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get this impression that they rent the same podium and technique as well.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be made of this discontent depends not only on the supply of money, but also whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine doesn't become four and more dosed.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or center movement, bet that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost definitely become multi-dose, since it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every half a year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
End Stalemate, Bulgaria Has New Prime Minister Reaching Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked with assembling a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections.
That has already managed to put together a government of broad coalition that is expected to take office within days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the past government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost elections.
However, the victorious parties preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not be agreed, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
Of the “secretly” footage taken, it is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been searching for days by London police.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home to the south of the British metropolis from work.
For information about a children's hospital worker, besides the police, calls from her existing employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
Šumperska amateur children's room painter Zdeněka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councilor) said that she violates copyright by her paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of the Mole in the Šumperské humperské rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch has appeared for a month.
It was about life.
The Magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs to, and because it said it was unresponsive, the hole went on.
Eventually the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to “intensively deal with the situation”.
The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the substitutes' bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning US time, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The Pilsen hockey player finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not catch a single game in the pandemic-shortened year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, his save success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille on her Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also posted his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported about it on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Like Princes George and Louis, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile at their country home in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which is color-coordinated with the light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, mainly figures.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt behavior.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal behavior, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked last year in mid-October by a police intervention at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically of a worse type (the gunners have to carry cartridges from the armored cabin by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria were climbing out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat down there.
As I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before anything came up, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, it was a mess.
That is, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imager, which almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive things in a visible place by your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for a respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that trained people can use, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerillas are going to lead and it is also a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such scale and intensity that guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for that.
mainly we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act like they have it.
Then such a situation arises that you watch as a guy who didn't hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think will happen now?"
Well, of course they'll win him over like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick the defender" skill is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up first on the tape also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks grew."
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you no.
In the West they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of warhead deployment due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only warheads were kept, not entire rockets, as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit arrived and picked up this warhead and mounted it on some sort of support device.
In addition to the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was short, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same year, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian medical rescuers, told Práv.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet determined, drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian Police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and hand over data to the post office for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls to supply the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen that's inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get for example added (who is an employee)?
They gave me 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect his/her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went about it in a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted advice from the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore handled by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA:')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specialties, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly floundering, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well, please, man.
All it takes is one election in the US to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they only need to show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks these days, but a cheerful teenager behind the stick of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your house is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
By agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cardboard has become 50% more expensive in recent years.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, old electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are gradually increasing in it, which help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I rather feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo apps, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron laid out the priorities for France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they can't be made in six months.
But French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is engaged in pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler in World War II, wasn't so bad, and he's having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the Year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the top of the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone feels that way)

Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the fall.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will make a total of 16 daily connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the running times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned shutdown works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in Českolipsko, for example, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they died.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them, while they were killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and there were a lot of things they were against too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact are called feminists, as are other groups such as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more likely to encounter bad geography, but that was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it's interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always talks some crap about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him either this time, they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Breclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Breclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing has changed about the delivery of flamingo in the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light first by train to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, December 18 by scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the distance, there should be as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and girl scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education use the money properly, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices in the corridors "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the inhibition of development when this company hangs on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also falls into some kind of trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads don't move me, but then I catch myself that they have influenced me too - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
For this reason too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban those internets.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is covert thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says after all"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the Christmas movie trend and will present a record-breaking more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came with a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competing station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't really matter, what matters is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas movie book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to at least feel a little peace for two hours in the midst of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding, which is resolved successfully and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will thus send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he won in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after all.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will take to the track from the last row, Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepin is relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there is another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO countries, in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is examining another case of a child from Adamovo.
"Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov is not proven," said Ciupek.
In the week, six cases appeared in the region.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of those mentioned traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they have contact with anyone who resided abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being checked.

California to restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to damages from anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's US Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Texas abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that results from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to remain in place and greatly supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban here as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict, warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing select officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already being widely published in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should soon be on the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobr's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the most powerful and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never make such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to know it... At Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I don't even go to any market anymore, events, events, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it's in some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't really care anymore.
For two years I've been watching how data is treated like manure here, most opponents of vaccination are just a little more out of line than most proponents of vaccination.

I was punished with a wooden spoon in my childhood.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "caught" she only brought a wooden spoon and laid it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a few kicks on the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (reasonably implemented and to an extent) are beneficial because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child, in a way, a choice of disobeying and receiving, or improving and not being punished.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which he swears and which he learned about in school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely leaning towards the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is emerging more and more frequently among lawyers.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (of which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, the constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the game's constraints for politicians.
We fear that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to use their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder on children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novinkám.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
This takes place at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
However, he is pleased that no children have died from the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the Brno National University Hospital.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the vaccination dose even in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside of marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so closely monitored outside of national parks).

China is building the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for its failure to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, for example even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and tells him: hey, don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want, I will sell you the elephant for 5,000.
Friend: okay, I'll slap myself, that'll be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought that too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines" where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", that is, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing with words:D
Either way, it's a meaningless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
She has now been banned from keeping animals for life by Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse have said they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was handed a 12-week prison sentence at Gwent Magistrates' Court, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from anyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered the horrific footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat over drug allegations.
Milly can be heard swearing profanity in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell.
1,600 pounds worth of cocaine hidden in Kinder eggs was found in her house.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same things in freshman year as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffoonery, when no one, honor to the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if you can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even bother to tell you that they're totally screwed.
So what the fuck is he learning to do?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need to.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need this thing.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was completely serious... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the time when not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and persecution against educated people and elites probably also participate) However, the price of having barbarians stand by those machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists could count, then covid here probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why he can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all sorts of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it creaked from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, that is, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he fumed at Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's alleged honesty with his now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said these things to each other very much.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't stand it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most despite his young age.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, in the end he stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage then shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.
When it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberecko region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 candidates applied for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in the Uhersko-Hradišť region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters voting for them.
The previous mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Private Party, also got into the council on their behalf again.
Komňané - independent candidates - won one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimovsk region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia na Mosteck were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate Obec pro lid, which received the vote of 43.27 percent of the voters, finished second, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberecko were won by the independent candidates Naděj pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, winning one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know very well everything that people here write to you.
You're just playing the fool so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30-year-old one
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, for example, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
A man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
After arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to his life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical personnel are primarily on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at the UFC 269 tournament.
The outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who did not find a conqueror for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Also picking up a win was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a first-round technical KO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf," because Nunesová had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, sending her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on her arm.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other with a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock back the attack.
The American thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the tide gradually turned.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, and tried to hit the opponent with a lever on the arm.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a sovereign triumph, having already used a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he charged him with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
His hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for whom the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "hip" are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter according to the pattern of "song."
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "order/order," "cabbage/cabbage" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, so are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "prikop" and "prikopa," "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but they gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained uninflected in the middle gender, but has endings in the masculine one following the pattern of "castles."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise Greece support, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
But too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "most of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sex offenders.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to finish them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of it.
She does not have the funds to finish the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the family houses that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and pay the rent on top of that," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them happened to us.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earning," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment became the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of construction graduates and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance into the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
As for that, the diploma seems great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
Stateswomen are completely at ease with us, if a person is not a total macaque and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state book, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately realized and I got it right.
Otherwise about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when there is an exam at the end of the course, in which the knowledge gained within the project is reflected, not just a defense.
Everything is fine, but don't flood the e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be a pee like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under artists' feet.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been really bugging me lately, so maybe I'll have to downsize to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't let it go.
In the end, I might even be happy if something user-friendly came along that doesn't drain all the creativity and energy from the artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
The union - yes, the breakup - no, opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Belovezhsky Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Białowieża Forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, separated from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
This crap about how if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about god, I was confused, but I suspected it was going to be some kind of agitator.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like he was a good motherfucker, full of completely useless lessons, like I should wash myself and not be a dick.
It's a shame about the paper, because of this the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out with a friend whom she didn't like to talk to.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and she started to be beaten on a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her, but that I could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not run amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who would not even know about the terrible disease if it were not for the test.
All we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with this joke and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing faggots.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment is returning to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't need to be interested, mainly get people."
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wanted to earn money, one had to scrounge several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump at every tip and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced many such things in the company where I work.
HR is calm, the managers look after their management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it takes place it works quite well for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're an almost-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we will not release any more information about the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on her way home from work, she had to withdraw money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing persons around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.
At the end of the year, new councils were appointed in four municipalities
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberecko region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for the new elections to councils in the mentioned four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission, and after approval they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be stripped of the office of president and the ability to assume it again.
But as others here mention, the chances that this will actually happen are very small.
Moreover, I am not sure that the shredding of the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year is increasing
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven't had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they had been without sex in the last year.
It was 29% for single people. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people and married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force part of the population to behave that they don't want but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. for example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think that we are to blame for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, is yelling something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
Czechia without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské 50, for example.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about pan-girls.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down one such quite wide street and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, the teacher and I asked her what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're very spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group" bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce's cheesy film Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film Here We Watch is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Tady hlídám ja from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some well-known characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the storytelling process in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken by her family to a hospital so that a miraculous healing process by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and then sits stuffed and made-up with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and slop like a cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
No matter how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only plus point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-whistles, let alone the more popular profanities the characters commit.
The argument is not even years of membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from idiots just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to kids like that, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports just six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasím Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater resource, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation here may decrease," predicted in 2018 the spokeswoman for the Israel Water Management Authority, Uri Schor.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
Tank trucks are increasing on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I helped the lady a little and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these fakes, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, they were awaited by plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas have started operations as a result.
Skiers were not deterred even by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná na Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski center in Branná, was full of praise.
Ski area operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or within a period of time after experiencing covid-19.
With some exceptions, people are ready for it and prove it with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one fine day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
Another question is elections at all.
If life is bad here, some traditional V4 maniac can win here too.
The young and the educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, also calls on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and worked here for our health care," said Harman.
The police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made him think that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are valid in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Starý Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and traffic will be adjusted on 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on a dozen central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, has been canceled or newly restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsk.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy's next door or Lidl a little further.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and quickly buy at most pizza buns and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And these are not trees that you must see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
But he said he packed her, not the other way around.
They have been the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them even out of a can, or us, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wants to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match for each other, or you insist that everyone really knows the list of your ex-partners in detail and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a joke, that's what you want, bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as the vice president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they have only been together for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We too are only people, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and, like him, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found sublease together, which seems to me to be the best option because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you get on).
So I've never looked for rent, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own money, or let them follow the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed himself in this way about a petition action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So for you, a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitization that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it out of sight, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in a note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and find the one closest to you.
But since it seems that you are drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that matches what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odryan Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they are not allowed:D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in a fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I know of no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is the fault of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture are also recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also increases the impacts.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "lama China", losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they point out, what the referees notice or do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won."
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections were registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said on television on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually," via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is growing in Britain to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During a strict lockdown in London last December and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to profit from it, and does other small or big tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely hard (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to relieve myself, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand for example (so that I wouldn't get too hard on the handle), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but the upbringing certainly has a part to play.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational", but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least not a little cold, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those that the law creates in such a quality as kundas.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused in the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No way, they let themselves be fooled and the company took the fall.
Czech television was dying of covid six months ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage is nowhere to be found
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíčk needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments expect from the law a significant strengthening of their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
Municipalities particularly criticize the draft law from Minister Karel Havlíčk, which is available to the Platform: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a location for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting specific proceedings.
The submitted draft of the substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in some permit procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
Any action does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and is a follow-up to the contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is expected to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who only pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient municipal rights for such a fundamental construction in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to take it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably be looking for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
On top of that, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses, right, so "boss" is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are the mini bosses.
It's probably not even possible to translate boss in one word at a time, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent, is interesting).
In short, it is generally significant to the story or the game, a computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous ones and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
He has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czech Republic before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month attacks significantly intensified as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The malicious code actively searches for saved credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is growing again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt also continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts note a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are increasing in popularity, it reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy Inside Out.
Sometimes I have the impression that they also rent the same stage and equipment.
It is difficult to say which movement could be bribed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which humanity is justifiably proud.
The stalemate is over, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption We Continue Change movement, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The footage taken "secretly" is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her previous employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person as violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumava's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to "resolve the situation intensively."
The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the substitutes' bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was replaced exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
He was recalled from the farm on Sunday morning US time, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not play a single game in the pandemic-shortened year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, his save success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille on the Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported about it on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile at their country home in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a veil over his face, helps Camille put on her veil, which is color coordinated with the light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got access to part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal behavior, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked last year in mid-October by a police intervention at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically of a worse type (the gunners have to carry cartridges from the armored cabin by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it was already possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat down there.
As I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before anything came up, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pissed himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, it was a mess.
That is Even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imager, which almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive things in a visible place in a sleeping bag by your feet and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior obtained respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that trained people could use, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerillas are going to lead and it's a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such scale and intensity that guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for that.
mainly we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act like they have it.
Then such a situation arises that you watch as a guy who didn't hit an empty net 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they vote for him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick the defender" skill is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks grew".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you no.
In the West they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
Then it looks good in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of warhead deployment due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only warheads were kept, not entire rockets, as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit would come and pick up this warhead and mount it on some sort of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to push me on the price, communication was smooth.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already transferred it to himself..
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemia's paramedics, told Práv.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for reasons not yet determined, drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian Police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After he was rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector adds.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and provide data to the post office for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click a checkbox or two, put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls to supply the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed, and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get for example added (who is an employee)?
They gave me 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect his/her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went about it in a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted advice from the police officers on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore handled by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are approximately ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all than to risk choosing wrongly out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly floundering, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well please, man.
All it takes is one election in the USA to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they only need to show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications, that's a fart these days, but a hot-headed teenager behind the stick of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
By agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, old electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, and reusable things can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the by the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
I rather feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo applications, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron laid out the priorities for France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they could not be covered in six months.
However, French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is engaged in pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler in World War II, wasn't so bad, and he's having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the top of the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy/fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone feels this way)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a living together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets already in the fall.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier here will replace České dráhy after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will make a total of 16 daily connections on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the running times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned shutdown works.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in Českolipsk, for example, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they were dying.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them, while they were killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone intentionally withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and there were a lot of things they were against too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there are also in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact are labeled as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If something connects me with people, it's interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is an awfully nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always talks some shit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans, and they even have mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him either this time, they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year with the troop, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing has changed regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light first by train to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, December 18 by scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the distance, there should be as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, male and female scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices in the corridors "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the inhibition of development when this company hangs on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads don't move me, but then I catch myself that they have influenced me too - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
It is also for this reason that I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban those internets.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says after all"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the Christmas movie trend and will present a record-breaking more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came with a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competing channel Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't really matter, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas movie book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies ( I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to at least feel a bit of peace for two hours in the midst of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV always uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding, which is resolved successfully and the two kiss.
That's the way it goes, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people keep watching one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will take to the track from the last row, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can be locked up for this too.
And everyone will be robbed, the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activity or confiscation of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
c) if, by doing so, he violates an important obligation resulting from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if he causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarovski company.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there is one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the help of NATO countries, in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.

"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of those mentioned have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being checked.
There were also players from South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales
He wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortion.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against fetal heartbeat detection.
People would then be entitled to damages by suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Texas abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to remain in place and greatly supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict, warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue select officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already being widely published in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should soon be on the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.
Feel free to leave the amount of the curriculum.
But rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these things, it would be possible to cut down really brutally.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that he will necessarily need for life?
How can I legally watch Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have a Netbox at home and I pay for a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League but I don't want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobr's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the most powerful and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, uncommon and specialty cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If I can avoid it, I don't even bother going to any market anymore, a sale, a sale, a gold shop on the square, maybe they don't have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it's in some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't really care anymore.
For two years I have watched the data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccines are just a little more out of line than most of the pro-vaccinators.
Although rational discussion takes place at the professional level, only extreme opinions reach the public space.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This is how this country is and we are like this.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two countries is not addressed by anyone.
Phew, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a wooden spoon in my childhood.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "tap" she would only bring a wooden spoon and put it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of kicks on the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice, in a way, to disobey and get it, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document to which he swears and which he learns in school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary , he was definitely leaning towards the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is emerging more and more often among lawyers.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the game rules for politicians.
We fear that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder on children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novinkám.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
He is happy, however, that no children have died from the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the National University Hospital in Brno.
According to the available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in a children's hospital – not just in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the vaccination dose for children as well," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside of marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course outside of national parks it is not so closely monitored).
How does a conductor practice?
Music goes through my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He was weaned by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire and works as a conductor not only in the F. Šalda Theater in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for its failure to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, for example even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with the trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want, I will sell you the elephant for 5,000.
Friend: yes, I'll slap myself, that will be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought that too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing with words :D
Either way, it's a ridiculous request
An earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-magnitude earthquake hit the Japanese capital Tokyo and surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage was reported yet.
No tsunami warning was issued either, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
She has now been banned from keeping animals for life by Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court she was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered the horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat over drug allegations.
Milly can be heard swearing profanity in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: "You want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell.
1,600 pounds worth of cocaine was found in her house (roughly 50,000 crowns), hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same things in freshman year as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffoonery, when no one, with the exception of honor, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if you can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even bother to tell you that they're totally screwed.
So what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need to.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need this thing.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was completely serious... ...because you simply don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the time when not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part) However, the price of having barbarians stand by those machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these dimensions.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why he can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it was creaky from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, that is, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he fumed at Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's supposed honesty with his now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said these things to each other very much.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't stand it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most despite his young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, in the end he stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.
When it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberecko region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 candidates applied for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Eva Krumpová, deputy chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komni in the Uhersko-Hradišť region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of the voters voting for them.
Jana Křižková, the previous mayor of the village, who is a member of the Private Party, also got into the council on their behalf again.
Independent candidates won one mandate in the local council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimovsk region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia na Mostecko were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate Obec pro lid, which received the vote of 43.27 percent of the voters, finished second, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberecko were won by the independent candidates Naděj pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of the voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that you know very well everything that people here write to you.
You're just playing the fool so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, for example, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
A man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
After arriving at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger to his life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokesperson of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical personnel are primarily on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
After all, things happened at the UFC 269 tournament.
The outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who did not find a defeater for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Also picking up a win was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf", because Nunesova had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, sending her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack using her arm lever.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other with a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock back the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the cards gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, and tried to hit the opponent with a lever on the arm.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a sovereign triumph, having already used a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he charged him with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
His hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "hip" are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter according to the pattern of "song".
Another group of nouns has different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "rádek/rádka", "kedluben/kodlubna" or "brambor/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "príkopa", " donut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but they gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained uninflected in the neuter, but in the masculine has endings following the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by those around them or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
However, too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "most of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sex offenders.
The Czechia is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to finish them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of it.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them have done it.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earning," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of construction graduates and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," explained Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance into the new year has also traditionally been accompanied by politicians' speeches.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
As for that, the diploma seems great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
Stateswomen are completely at ease with us, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state book and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately understood and I got it right.
Otherwise about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the subject, in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
Everything is ok, but don't flood the e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be a pee like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in such a way that he can kick Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under artists' feet.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been really bugging me lately, so maybe I'll have to downsize to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't let it go.
In the end, I would perhaps be happy if something more user-friendly came along, which does not drain all the creativity and energy from the artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
Union - yes, disintegration - no, opponents of the disintegration of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża Forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I will buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
This crap about how if something is cheap it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about god, I was confused, but I suspected it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, he was a good old man, full of completely useless lessons, like how I should wash myself and not be a dick.
It's a shame about the paper, because of this the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out with a friend whom she did not like to hang out with.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and she started to be beaten on a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her, but that I could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to run amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who would not even know about the terrible disease if it were not for the test.
All we get is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the West, they have stopped with this farce and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is coming back to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't need to be interested, mainly get people".
I was honestly interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump at every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced many such things in the company where I work.
HR is calm, the managers look after their own management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it takes place it works quite well for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not release any further information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on her way home from work, she had to withdraw money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing persons worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.
By the end of the year, four municipalities were assigned new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberecko region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for the new elections to councils in the mentioned four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission, and after approval they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be stripped of the office of president and the ability to assume it again.
However, as others have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for an entire year is increasing
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven't had sex in the past year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex in the last year.
Among unmarried people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people and married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people have a divided opinion on premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the 'less religious', the trend rose from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole covid vaccination mandate is about whether or not society should force a segment of the population into behavior that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and I am personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e. for example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think that we are to blame for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, mutters something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in recent times in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské Padesátka, for example.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about pan-girls.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such rather wide street, and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce's cheesy film Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film Tady hlídáme we is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady hlídám ja from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the storytelling process in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and immediately sits curled and made-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slop like a cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
No matter how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only plus point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity the characters commit.
Even years of membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club are not an argument - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from idiots just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to kids like that, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasím Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation here may decrease," predicted in 2018 the spokeswoman for the Israel Water Management Authority, Uri Schor.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, they were awaited by plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred even by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators do not complain about lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed by the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná na Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski center in Branná, was full of praise.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within a period of time after experiencing covid-19.
With some exceptions, people are ready for it and prove it with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of the Králové Hradec company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were already almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one fine day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
Another question is elections at all.
If life is crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his bloodied face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, also calls on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labor politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working here for our health care," Harman said.
The police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made him think that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to that.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will soon expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and traffic will be adjusted on 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when express line number 404 will depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, has been canceled or newly reduced.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
A healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy's next door or to Lidl a little further.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and quickly buy pizza buns at most and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And these are not trees that you must see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
It is said that he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them even out of a can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a joke, that's what you want, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as the vice president of the Juventus football club.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they have only been together for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We too are only people, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and I stand by him just as he stands by me. For better or for worse, Rollins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subletting together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know, who will you live with
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlo, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don't know where exactly you get on).
So I've never looked for rent, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it out of their own money, or let them follow the state's rules and the state will pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state subsidy and thanks to that he will be able to learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed himself in this way about a petition action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So, for you, a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing/digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it out of sight, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in a note that it is unreadable .
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're pulling from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply made up their own mark to match what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they are not allowed :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasova's words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, claims Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I know of no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so only firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is the fault of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czechia is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture are also recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the impacts.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a hoot.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "llama China", losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they point out, what the referees notice or do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czechia lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections were registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said on television on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omikron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is growing in Britain to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During a strict lockdown in London last December and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to profit from it, and does other small and big tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided precincts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you speak of?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely hard (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to relieve myself, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand for example (so that I wouldn't get too hard on the handle), so never anything extreme, but always I have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but my education certainly has a part to play.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least not a little cold, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call those that the laws create in such a quality as kundas.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused in the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No way, they let themselves be fooled and the company rejected it.
Czech TV was dying of covid half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage is nowhere to be found
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments expect from the law a significant strengthening of their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
Municipalities particularly criticize the draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal of the substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in some permit procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is approximately 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient municipal rights for such a fundamental construction in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep storage unites 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to take it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal or university text, I would probably be looking for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, so "boss" is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It's probably not even possible to translate boss in one word at a time, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent, is interesting).
In short, it is generally significant to the story or the game, a computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous ones and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
He has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czechia before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month attacks significantly intensified as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
Malicious code actively searches for saved credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is increasing again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still responsible for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts note a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's bunch of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Based on footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say which movement could be bribed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or center-right movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which humanity is justifiably proud.
The stalemate is over, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption We Continue Change movement, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
It has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The footage taken "secretly" is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or the member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person as violating copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
Big Czech unlucky fellow to come back soon.
Pavel Francouz has been recalled by NHL.
Czech ice-hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has passed a hard period in his career over the past few months, is going to join NHL again.
A 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and soon, he could be even in the cage as well.
The former goaltender in Litvínov, Pilsen or Thcheljabinks in Russia got injured while preparing for NHL this October.
Just at the half of the match against Vegas, he was on the bench and has not appeared on ice since then.
The incident happened the moment when the experienced goaltender was moving from one post to another.
“Pavel Francouz will be absent for about three or four week, as he's suffered an injury in the lower part of his body,” Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His comeback to NHL's cage finally lasted for more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon of EDZ, he was recalled from a ranch, where he scored in four duels and showed his shape again.
In AHL, he scored 94,5 % of tackles.
Pilsen ice-hockey former charge wants to break through finally and confirm that he belongs to the best world's league.
In the last year, he had some troubles with his joint hips and he did not score in any of the short pandemic year's tackles.
In NHL, “Francík” scored 36times, he has reached almost 92,3 % in rankings.
Charles putting a face mask on Camilla's face in Christmas card, William and Kate posing in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photograph as this year's Christmas card, which was made during their journey to Jordan.
Also Prince Charles has published his Christmas card, he used a photograph in which he is helping his wife Camilla put a face mask on her face during a horse racing.
The BBC has informed about that on their web page.
They send the cards to their friends, co-workers and foundations which they cooperate with.
The photograph was made somewhere in a desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki colour and also Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Prince Louis shorts and a polo T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who made the photograph, and it is not sure where it was taken.
Last year, the Royal Family posed in the Christmas card on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their country residence in Norfolk County.
A picture, which will be used as a Christmas card, has also been published by the successor to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photograph Sam Hussein took a picture of them in June at the horse racing in Ascot.
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder hat on his head and a face mask on his face, is helping Camilla put on her face mask that matches with a light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised one million crowns to Berbr for winning the champoinship, Tvrdík denies.
Prague – The police reportedly investigated that Roman Berbr, the accused former Vice-chairman of the Football Association in the Czech Republic, should have been given one million crowns by Prague Slavia for winning the championship in 2018/19.
Server efotbal.cz informed about that saying that they got a few police documentation.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Vršovice club board member, said that Slavie did not commit any fraud.
The server published the police wiretaping transcription in which mainly Slavia's former sport director Jan Nezmar appeared , who left the champion club last summer.
Slavia's former powerful functionary was, based on the police documentation, often in contact with both Berbr and Vyšehrad's former sport director Roman Rogoz, who has been also accused.
The police are said to have information that Slavie promised to give some money to Berbr if he wons the championship.
In 2019, team SK Slavie Praha won the championship in the first league.
The police knew that functionaries of SK Slavie Praha reportedly promised to give one million crowns to Roman (Berbr) for winning the league, as the server quoted the documentation.
One day later, Berb met, according to the police, not only Nezmar, but also Tvrdík, Slavie's chairman of the board.
It is not clear whether the police is still investigating that information.
Tvrdík denied committing any fraud.
Between years 2015 and 2017, we tried hard to change the situation in the Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative of its development.
We've never committed any fraud, influenced coaches in contrary to fair play or provided any financial compensation regarding this matter,” Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the record, Nezmar, among others, is unscrupulously insulting some of former Slavie players who have dark skin and he is also slandering his ex-boss Tvrdík.
The case of reportedly match influencing by coaches started in mid-October last year by the police raid to a few sites, including FAČR's Prague site.
Berbr, who doesn't work for any football association any more, has the most important position in the case.
In mid-January, he was released from custody just like Rogor, the former Vyšehrad's sport director.
Helicopters, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles is a larping of the Cold War.
Cannons will be new, but the are basically of worse quality (artillery men must get out of an armoured cabin and carry ammunition by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyoty hi-lux - these are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - good quality, moreover, Praga V3S is no longer used by special forces.
Airplanes: fighter aircrafts - good quality, but their rental is ending, airliners - too small with short flight range, but modern
Drones - only few and small kinds with no combat potential
Missiles - none (but they are produced and exported)
Anti-aircraft warfare: medium - from the Cold War period, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good quantity
I'll tell you a story.
About a hunt just next to the town.
Coypus were coming from the river and making damage to the harvest, so I went there.
When I was arriving, I saw a fisherman on the other river bank.
I didn't want to bother anyone, so I sat down quietly and that guy didn't even notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before any animals would appear, but, of course, there appeared a fox in a little while.
I let her come closer by 40 metres and then I decided to start shooting.
The poor fisherman almost scared the shit out of him, he was waving by head torch everywhere, so I shouted that I aimed at the fox.
Before I left my high seat, he'd gone.
That means, you may get into trouble even on a meadow.
On the other hand, that's not a war, that must be a coincidence so that anything might happen, you'd probably be seen through thermovision, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So go to a visible place, keep expensive things in a sleeping bag with you and you'll be all right.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior bought respirators for a much lower price that the Ministry of Health did.
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks and respirators for people who are most threatened by the COVID-19 in their jobs, spent billion of crowns to buy them in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared purchase of both ministries and found out that there was a difference by up to hundreds of crowns only per one day.
Why was there such a dramatic difference in the prices?
What bodies purchased respirators economically?
And why other ones purchased for such high prices?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaking with Dominika Kubištová, an iRozhlas journalist.
I have a respect for soldiers and army (I'm not probably influenced by ČSLA memories as the older generation is), but the Czech Republic can't benefit from obligatory military service.
We don't even have big warehouses with technical equipment which could help training, we don't even have modern technologies for professional soldiers, besides, modern technologies are becoming more and more difficult, so reserve officers' skills won't be much good for the future.
Plus modern conventional conflicts where whoever can lead them will happen very quickly, there will be no time to train anyone else.
And last but not least, reserve officers/territory defense are very important for countries such as Ukraine where they can lead a mass guerrilla and it's utterly necessary to discourage en enemy.
In the Czech Republic, there will only be a fight within a conflict to such an extent and intensity that a guerrilla won't be relevant, and we don't even have a suitable geography.
And mainly, we don't have an individual skill.
And that's not the worst thing.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there occur such situations that you watch a guy who doesn't score an empty goal 2 minutes earlier, approaches attack on his own between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself “Holy shit, and what he thinks that's going to happen now?”.
Of course, they will fleece him like an average tax payer.
The situation with that skill “lead a defender” is so terrible that I found myself being sincerely surprised when I watch our striker defeating a player of the opponent.
Forerunners
The covid pandemic has been declining, however, experts do not predict any significant break in next few weeks.
Based on statistics models, there will still be lots of people in hospitals for some time, and there has appeared a new big one: the Omicron variant which has probably been spreading much more quickly than the widespread Delta variant.
At the same time, we cannot say certainly if it can cause more serious complications, if vaccination is effective or whether people will get post-infectious immunity after being infected.
However, there has also appeared a new unexpected positive phenomenon: the possibility of cure.
A new cure has arrived in the Czech Republic, namely antiviral medicine molnupiravir, which makes serious symptoms and hospitalizations less probable, by one third, and people can use it in their homes.
And soon, there should also appear medicine paxlovid developed by Pfizer, which, so far, has been reported to cure even 85 per cent of patients.
The first supplies of molnupiravir in the Czech Republic, together with hope for a wider portfolio of tools against the coronavirus pandemic, has raised the question how much the local administration is prepared for new coming medicines.
As it was said, molnupiravir developed by Merck will be the first medicine which local patients will use.
That is also because the medicine was used long before the pandemic outbreak in order to find a suitable cure for horse viral disease in the South America.
Such surveys usually don't take into account that people from western countries (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are in general less open and they don't share their point of views so openly.
On the other hand, people from eastern countries, especially Czech people, are used to talking very openly.
E.g., you make a survey on whether people like Muslims.
Most Czech people will say that they don't.
In western countries, people will say that they like immigrants, everyone should help them and that we Czechs are racists.
And then they go to elect political parties such as AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, if you say such things openly in public, you'll be fired from work and you'll be disgraced by media.
Then such surveys look nice, western countries are good, eastern countries are bad.
But the question is what people do really think.
In France, it's similar with Le Penn and Zemmour, they're supported by 20 % od people based on surveys.
We even know that there are such three buildings in the Czech Republic and they are quite identical.
They are identical for the reason of changing units so that soldiers don't have to learn again where they find things, so all buildings are completely the same.
One of them is Atom Muzeum Brdy nowadays and two other are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads in their own territory, whether because of safety or the speed of warheads fitting because of western location.
There were only kept warheads in the fallout shelters (there are two of them in each Javor), not the whole missiles, as they say.
If it were necessary to fit that weapon, a special unit, who had taken the warhead and fitted on a supporting facility, would come.
Except for the museum Javor, those two other are desolated.
When I attended the 2nd grade at basic school, I had a classmate, a gypsy, he was there for 4 years.
There were no problems with him, he made good jokes, sometimes, he was a bit hyperactive, but he was a kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, came to him and asked him to explain if they didn't understand anything, he was rarely absent, he regularly attended school, practised sports with us, didn't steal our snacks, mobile phones and he always wore neat clothes.
He also went to school field trips, made various tricks, but ha was all right, he was never in the shit.
When we attended the 8th or 9th grade, there came new pupils, siblings, gypsies, they attended the same grade, but a different class.
Shortly after that, they attacked a teacher, the police often had to solve problems with them, they menaced other pupils.
I sometimes put an advert when I want to sell something (old things that I don't need anymore etc.), and I often sold things to gypsies, they always had money, didn't try to overcharge me, the communication with them was easy-going.
I even sold a car that way, the guy called me a month later that the car had been assigned to him..
I think that I'm not a racist, I don't care if anyone has white, black, yellow, blue or whatever skin colour, until they behave like decent people (they work, make no troubles, don't beat women, just behave politely).
But if there's anyone who only needs money, makes damages to a flat, makes mess everywhere, makes troubles.. then I don't care about their skin colour, but I can't stand such people.
I don't mind migrants from Africa if they want to integrate, do business, work, learn our language (or English, at least), have respect for our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care until they respect my traditions and culture, then I will respect theirs, too.
Young woman dies in car crash in Pardubicko region
“A young woman was seriously wounded and despite the resuscitation given, she died on the spot,” Zuzana Fajtlová, the spokeswoman of southern Bohemia paramedics, said to Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot car was probably going from Žíchovec to Bavorov and for unknown reason, he went in the opposite direction.
After the crash with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot car ended up on its roof outside the road, as the accident was described by Štěpánka Schwarzová, the spokeswoman of the southern Bohemia police.
The young Peugeot driver was seriously injured.
He suffered many wounds and got stuck in the car.
After getting him out of the car, he had to be pre-treated urgently by paramedics and then, being stabilized, he was transported by a helicopter to hospital in České Budějovice, Fajtlová said.
She added that the other car driver was only slightly injured in his chest and was taken to hospital.
New regulations on packages from EU, customers not often informed
Lukáš Neuheisl make foreign orders a few times a month.
He usually buys collection cards.
“Usually, it costs tens of dollars, let's say ten dollars and more, if it's still worth importing, especially in Japan, where postal service is often free of charge,” the collector says.
Since October, orders of small packages have become more expensive, VAT has been newly added and the buyer has to give information on customs proceedings to the post office.
Then he receives an-email informing him that custom officers wait for the parcel delivery.
Then he has to fill in information about the package and if VAT has not been included in the order by the seller, it will be assessed by custom officers based on the total amount for the order including transportation cost.
In case that the address does not ensure customs proceedings, a carrier commission needs to be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole proceedings are not complicated.
I check one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and it's done.
It usually takes me five minutes, Neuheisl says.
However, not every packages are delivered in such an easy way.
Due to new customs regulations, there has been a decrease in delivered foreign orders per day in Prague post office from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond if they ask them to give details needed for successful customs proceedings.
Currently, there have been 30,000 foreign packages to be processed at the international post office.
If people filled in all details needed in time, we would processes half of the packages, Matyáš Vitík, the spokesman of česká pošta, says.
Inflation solution
See headline, how would you solve the current inflation?
At the moment, the inflation rate is 9,9 % and they expect its increase.
So in your opinion, what should the state do to stop the increase or compensate it?
For example, we can see the decrease of VAT on food and PHM in Poland, do you think that's the right way?
What in your opinion might happen, what is inevitable, what the future situation be?
Prices are increasing much more quickly that salaries, in my opinion, it' inevitable that people won't afford buying even standard products, and particularly energies.
How much has your salary raised this year (I mean as an employee)?
My gross salary raised by 2 %, which is funny, but fortunately I do some business on my own except my main job and I have the same salary from that.
Can anyone explain to me how does it come that provably convicted rapists are imprisoned for let's say just 6 months or so?
I can't get my head round it, how can be such a beast sent to prison for no longer than 6 months by a court of, and they can do the same things once they're released?
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that their victims will face trauma for several years, it will influence their sexual relations in a negative way and relations in general.
Not speaking that rape victims can face trauma from till the end of their lives.
Is it possible that the this and also future reports could prevent from raping?
Man from Hrob “fingered” his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from Hrob accidentally helped police officers find his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, who an arrest warrant was issued for.
It was him who called the police.
Anyway, hi did it another way.
At first, he stopped a passer-by and told them a fake story that he had been robbed.
Police officers arrived after an emergency call and they could not believe when the alleged “robbed man” told them that he had lied in order that they would come there.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the police officers how he could make a report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking identities of the man and his girlfriend, the police found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in the nationwide manhunt, and an arrest warrant for her had been issued.
So the case has been solved by the Police of the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
In my opinion, we haven't been Slavics from an ethnical and cultural point of view for a long time, but I'd like to know what you think about it.
Otherwise, I agree to the meme, of course, pity that Churchill did not manage to save Prague by the US :')
Of course, I don't deny that we've got a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's a question if a reasonable person might believe in God without having any proof and just because one could possibly benefit from it.
I don't think that's a real faith.
I can't agree with Pascal, if I'm not mistaken, there are about ten thousand religions all over the world.
What god or gods should one choose?
I'd say that it's quite probable that in one of all those religions, there exists at least one god who will punish you if you believe in another god.
Also it is said in the Ten Commandments that there is no other God than Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more logical if one doesn't believe in any god instead of choosing a bad one among others and the very god who one doesn't choose will send them to the Hell or a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training and later becoming a part of reserve units.
The Swiss model is similar, if I'm not mistaken.
X months of training (in different skills, X months for one) and trained by experienced professional soldiers.
If one is good at it, they might be offered to do a professional service.
That would be useful for all units of the AČR.
It could be done with cooperation of the University of Defence.
We can speak like that: They have continued talking about cooperation between the educational and industry sectors, companies look for recruits at schools and there has been something like mutual penetration when working people go from schools to offices.
Not only when you grow up, but that process has been there all the time, everyone of us has still been learning new skills, changing fields etc.
A similar penetration would be also between the civil and army sectors.
I see that also like the way for building a relationship between a citizen and army, that means an institution which guarantees that Russians, Germans or a Mongolian raider will never invade us again.
It seems funny to me the way you consider the NATO as our save, we have allies and they will defend us in case there's a trouble.
Good Lord!
One election in the US might lower the budget and the whole NATO would be fucked up.
British will change us for Russian money, Germans will change us for Russian gas and Polish has showed that they would take whatever they want.
The only steady guarantee of independence is having a strong army and people who can use modern army technologies.
And every teenager can pilot remote controlled equipment nowadays, so why wouldn't that be possible.
We don't need any border fortifications, it's good for nothing nowadays, but a teenager with a spotty face piloting a remote controlled equipment will know their ropes.
How you can avoid drowning in “box tsunami”!
You will open gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly, you will get flooded by boxes and fillings?
Such “waste” is used again by e-shops which are short of wrapping materials.
For that reason, there has been made a map of shops which will welcome your used boxes.
And not only during Christmas.
Alle wrapping materials are designed in the way that they can be used repeatedly.
That's why it would be a pity if you threw them away after using.
Whoever can bring, after an agreement, carton boxes, plastic or paper filling in shops which belong to the project (the map of the project KAMsNIM.cz shows almost 150 of them).
You can support small companies, reduce waste and also overfull containers.
Shops themselves will welcome wrapping materials which have been missing on the market currently, and they will also save money, as the prices of cardboard have increased by 50 % lately.
Moreover, such shops seem to be more ecological for some customers.
TIERRA VERDE, eco drugstore and cosmetics producer, is one of those shops.
Boxes and filling materials are taken to our shop in Popůvky u Brna by individuals who have got plenty of them at their homes, however, even some companies contact us and we agree with them on taking used carton boxes from them.
We use everything when packing orders from our e-shop.
Thanks to such people and companies, we make the world more considerate together.
Our aim is to preserve sources and beauties of the nature for next generations, Petra Lopušníková from Tierra says.
However, application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points of used materials.
It serves also like a browser if you need to get rid of anything (sorted out waste from households, expired medicine, tires, old electrical appliances, batteries, lightings, high-volume waste etc.).
All waste can be taken to the right place and things that can be used again will find their second homes.
The map of the project shows in total more than 100,000 such places.
“Slowly, there have been added civic amenity sites, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places which help find use of things that would otherwise become waste”, Miroslav Kubásek, one of the creator of the application from organisation Ukliďme Česko, says.
It rather seems bad to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or mobile phones play games on them, but they don't learn basic IT knowledge.
Recently, there has occurred a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students don't understand files on computers.
Because e.g. Google Pics or Apple Pics applications or mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem including files and everything is on one monitor in the application.
They can use technology since their childhood, but they should learn something.
We rewrite history, indeed
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend – starting in January – and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for more than one hour, revealing the presidency logo, called on for the protection of the European people – at work, in streets – and talked about so many plans that one could hardly make them up in half a year.
However, French politicians like such talks, and so do French voters.
Macron's supporters balancing between the right wing and the left wing agree on very few things, but they do on European matters.
And there will be new presidential elections in France in April.
Even priorities themselves have influenced the election calendar.
The French leader mentioned, among others, that historians should write “a comprehensive history book about Europe” and France is prepared to make conditions for such work.
Most commentators criticised immediately that Macron is just trying to make a pro-Europe campaign and rewrite history.
In fact, he is trying to prevent from rewriting history by that.
Éric Zemmour, an extreme right candidate to the French presidency, is just going around France, proclaiming that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the World War II, was not so bad and he is quite popular with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea about a comprehensive history book seriously without considering the current situation in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students from European countries study history like a story versus we and not like a story of the whole.
The Spanish, French, Czechs learn about who was defeated by whom in battles.
But if their teacher is not sophisticated, they will not learn about a wider context of occurrences.
Is Quo vadis, Aida this year's best movie?
The Czech “Mice” did not win.
A story describing the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 was also awarded for the best direction and the best actress Jasna Duričičova.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, it was at the top rankings by the audience.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins won the best actor prize for his performance in the movie The Father.
I'm not much young, not much healthy/fit and not vaccinated.
It was like “having the flu/being sick”. I had diarrhea for a few days and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse compared to the flu.
I don't have diarrhea when having the flu.
(Just my personal experience. Other people might have different one.)
Christmas book tips
A Christmas issue, which will be published on December 20th, will contain traditional literature appendix.
And some other culture tips will be published together with it.
I attach some book tips for you, subscribers, in addition to this digital issue so that you would have enough time for buying some books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts which follow the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
A new “portion” of watching the world and describing everyday life together with deep poet attentiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prosaic work, photographer Šesták tried to describe an essence of both a small town and the Czech society.
It's a description about return to roots which will turn just into a wanted illusion.
Czech studies and comparative literature transfer the fairy tale about the Little Red Riding hood in a real village of nowadays.
Its presentation is so brutal that it even surpasses traditional versions and becomes a horror story about an emotional emptiness.
And about that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his last but one novel, the author tells us a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration, different from what we are used to listening.
Those who stayed and those who left know very little of themselves for a common life.
New train timetables, new rail operators
Temporary train timetables have changed and new ones are effective as of Sunday.

Arriva trains and other train operators are not planning any substantial changes in their timetables.
There will be new train operators of a few local routes.
For example, there will be some changes in timetables concerning passengers in Českolipsko, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk operated by České dráhy will be replaced by trains operated by Trilex of German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will be also able to buy uniform tickets for the second year.
Just as České dráhy, their price will be raised by 3,2 % including the inflation rate.
I can't agree.
Don't we accept other people's points of view?
We can hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how much they were oppressed and they had to work hard and died.
During classes, I never heard how it was seen by slaveholders or anyone from those times, no one defends that, but just judge.
No one at school will tell you that black people were often sold as slaves by black people as well and that those were often the worst slaveholders.
No one will teach you at school that colonists often bought lands from the Indians, they just say how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, and in fact they slaughtered one another a long time before.
I spent some time in the US, too, at schools, both southern and northern schools.
No one did conceal facts, but I heard a long time before that they had done it, and in my opinion, that's a problem, I don't deny that (e.g. in Japan, no one speaks about cruel things which happened during the WWII).
I just wanted to point out that history isn't black and white and we tend to see it from nowadays point of view, without understanding it.
History doesn't study any feelings, it's just as it is and I think that it's a huge mistake to judge anything without having any points of view from those times.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat things that had happened.
By the way, while we're talking about southern states, yes, the Confederation flag and famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they were also successful at times and we shouldn't condemn them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better, most people make it ideal nowadays.
And many people also forget that not all people in the South were slaveholders and they didn't agree with many things, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they don't talk about certain things on purpose, they lie and manipulate with others, and they've got different points of view than we have (there was a video from TV on YT in which they stopped someone who was speaking about our legionaries and what happened in 1968).
What I found funny at US schools was the increase of Marxism and making communism ideal, they've never experienced that.
All in all it seemed to me that it was terrible at some universities, the students were quite radical and the universities even supported them.
And if I imagine that those people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick that those people could decide about things, as they are among young people and also within the ruling elite.
It seems to me that e.g. feminism has reached what it intended and it's changed, it's become radical.
Nowadays, there are many women who have nothing to do with feminists and ignore basic biological facts, and also other groups such as LGBT, and that makes people radical on both sides, which often leads to resistance to even quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical it is, the more you can hear about it.
To summarize that, I've never heard anyone judging me for being a colonist or slaveholder.
It was rather that people didn't have good knowledge of Geography, anyway it was mutual :D
That's not that I don't like it, there's just no point in it in my opinion.
Shall I be proud of anything what I haven't managed myself?
Moreover, I consider the nationality concept useless in the respect of any personal identity.
If I have anything to do with other people, then my hobbies, points of view on the world and joint experience, not the place where we were born.
I don't believe in God, but from what I know, I can tell you this: there are two Greek Orthodox parishes, one of them is Ukrainian and the second one is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a great man, his sermons are much more about theology than politics, but then he always say something stupid about the coronavirus so that everyone is ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact, their origin was in Catholic modern and they are, in fact, Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they visit the Hussite Church sermons as they are very similar theologically, but their members are mostly more liberal.
They have a wonderful church of historical value in Functionalism style in Botanická Street.
The Church of Saint Michal on Dominikánské square belongs to Dominicans and they even make sermons in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as they were made before Vatican II.
Peace Light of Betlehem is in Czech Republic, Scouts take it in Austria
Břeclav – The Peace Light of Betlehem, where Jesus Christ, according to Christians, was born, has been taken to the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not take it in Vienna this time, they took it from their Austrian coleagues at border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
They took it at the border crossing last year, too.
The Peace Light of Betlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we learn in our group every year, we look forward to it so much.
I'm honoured that I've been chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists.
While the handover took place at border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen last year, directly on the border bridge, this time it happened at border crossing Reintal – Břeclav, at the car park.
Anyway, the Scouts usually go to take it by train in Vienna.
The distribution of the light has not changed.
The Scouts took the light and went by train in Brno at first, where they gave it to bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The Scouts couriers distributed the light on Saturday December 18th, they will go by selected fast and passenger trains.
The local Scouts or volunteers will taje the light from them, who will then distribute it in other Czech regions with no railways.
The Scouts have to keep anti-covid regulations this year, too.
It is the same as last year.
We give recommendations to both courier teams and local events organizers, they should, of course, wear face masks, try to keep distance, avoid gathering, not sing together with their colleagues, just behave in a safe manner, Zuzana Hrbková, the spokeswoman of the Peace Light of Betlehem event, said.
The tradition of the Peace Light of Betlehem, which is distributed across Europe, was created in 1986, Austria.
Its aim is spread the idea of hope, light, friendship and peace together with the Peace Light of Betlehem.
For Christians, the Peace Light of Betlehem is a symbol of hope, light that overcomes dark.
The male and female Scouts have been in charge of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than thirty years.
The event is organised with the help of hundreds of volunteers, the light is also a symbol of unselfishness and human mutuality.
All news, including the list of all sites where people can come and take the light, are available on webpage www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I didn't study economics, so I don't know the basics of economics according to which subsidies are bad for economy, but I don't think that subsidies are trouble as a whole.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. increasing prices of water), health service and school system use all the money properly, I just don't understand why the money are invested in agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As I mentioned - there is produced a waste product and it threatens the free market and “a company natural life”.
I work in a company where you can see billions of posters “xy funded/co-funded by project xy” in corridors, such a company is just artificially subsidized to survive.
That isn't any support of a company which gives work to many people, that's development holdout as the company just survives and takes orders/employees from other companies that might develop and increase their productivity after its downfall.
I completely agree, that's terrible.
Sometimes, even a person who was born at the time of the Internet, is tricked or trapped - especially by commercials.
I personally think that Internet commercials don't influence me, but finally I get tricked and I'm influenced by them - they're made like that, one can't always resist.
For that reason, I support radical speeches at the European Parliament that want to impose a complete ban on programmed (= targeted) commercials...
Those are dirty tricks, in words by a classes - I'd ban the Internets.
It's my feeling that this belief has its roots in the following (but mainly in point 1):
1. “I will not believe in anything what most people do and it makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'd rather believe something what's less probable, it doesn't make any sense, but it's important that I have my own opinion which I'll say about it's critical thinking.”
2. “I will not believe in everything what media say”
3. “I don't trust politicians”
Televisions keen on Christmas movies trend, first nights of two hundred of them this year
Los Angeles – Movies, televisions and stream platforms in the U.S.A. and other English speaking countries have been keen on Christmas movies and they are going to introduce more than two hundred of them to spectators this year, which is record-breaking.
IMDb operator of the movie database counted the figures.
Christmas family and romantic movies have been very popular with spectators lately and the ratings has been increasing, that's why more and more of such movies have been produced.
This year, four times more Christmas movies have been made compared to year 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
IMDb database includes only those movies which include word Christmas in their titles, so there will be much more such movies, in fact.
There have always been movies which people consider Christmas ones.
In the Czech Republic, mainly fairy tales are typical for this period of the year, the most popular movies in the world are e.g. Sám doma, Láska nebeská or a traditional Christmas story Život je krásný from 1946.
But a real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable television Hallmark introduced a special movie series, BBC reminds.
Their Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four movies at that time and it was a great success.
This year, the television has started to attract their spectators since October 2nd and they are to launch 42 Christmas movies altogether.
The competitive channel Lifetime will launch 35 new Christmas movies this year, and the total number includes also favourite stream platforms, such as Netflix.
“During this charming period, the story itself is not so important, but it is important if you see lots of Christmas trees and snowing behind,” Brandon Gray, the author of book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, describes this period.
“It's an escape for spectators, the way how they can for at least two hours feel a bit calm during that all Christmas and world madness we've been living in over the past years,” Gray adds.
According to him, Hallmark, for instance, makes still the same movies, which is uniform, but successful.
There are two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is explained and those two ones kiss one another.
And it's still the same and until all movies are made like that with a similar atmosphere, people will watch one by one, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive, he is not to participate in final F1 race
Only 19 drivers will participate in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in F1.
Nikita Mazepin has been tested positive of COVID-19 and he will not participate in the final race of the season.
So stable Haas will send one racing car only.
In the final race of the season, he was supposed to reach a better position than the 20th, which he got during the qualification.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from stable Haas will not participate in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in F1 finally.
He has been tested positive of COVID-19.
So only 19 racing cars will be on the starting line, Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher will start from the last place, Max Verstappen, who will probably encounter Lewis Hamilton, will start from the first place.
According to stable Haas, Mazepin is quite well and has had no symptoms.
Nikita is all right, as he had no symptoms.
He is isolated now and he will respect public health authorities instructions, as security is a priority for all interested parties,” spokesmen of formula1.com said.
Haas will not send a stand-in driver in the race, they even can't
A stand-in driver would have complete the qualification or drives in another part of the weekend.
Not only one driver has been ill with COVID-19.
Kimi Räikkönen was also infected by COVID-19 at the end of the season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive last year.
You can be imprisoned for that as well.
And no one will care that the boss said.
According to law, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
That means it's included in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive jumper is amazing!
It is a bit like a movable jeweller's shop and its creator invested a half-a-year effort and all his savings in it.
“I had a vision of what I'd wanted to create, but only little experience, my family haven't worn jumpers a lot,” Liban, who spent 3,000 hours creating the project, said.
He bought silk in Italy, 24 carat golden threads in France and 2,000 small decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski company.
Then he decorated silver stars with 150 diamonds.
“Wool and cotton are basic materials, but it's silk what gives the jumper its softness,” the creator praises his work, which, however, he doesn't recommend to be washed.
And there is another catch in it.
“I'm totally broke, I must sell the jumper as soon as possible,” Liban admits.
If he is successful, a new world record will be set.
The most expensive jumper so far was sold for “only” 720,000 crowns five years ago.

But how could we raise the funding?
The EU gives us a lot of money as subsidies.
It it stops doing that, we won't get the money any more.
I don't really think that if the EU stops giving us money, we will use it for anything else...
You can say that the money from the funding could be used better, but that's another question.

Has Omicron variant spread in the south of Moravia?
The Public Health Authority is checking a new case of the Omicron variant in a child from Adamov.
“At the moment, there has been reported a new case of the Omicron variant in another child from a preparatory class in Adamov.
There has not been any proof of a direct contact with the previous cases at basic school in Adamov,” Ciupek said.
There have been reported six cases in the region over the past week.
“We are still waiting for an official confirmation of the Omicron variant in those six cases – it is done by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague,” the directress said.
She added that the cases included two nurses from the same department at the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, and then two 11-year-old pupils from basic school in Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the directress, three of them have light symptoms, four of them have no symptoms.
None of them travelled abroad.
None of them travelled abroad, neither any of their relatives, they were not in contact with anyone who was abroad.
There is no connection between the Water Polo Championship and the cases, Ciupek said.
The main public health officer Pavla Svrčinová said that they were checking the International Water Polo Championship, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago.
Two players from the South Africa took place in the championship and a Belgian player became sick after his return.
California to restrict gun sale.
They want to take the same measurements as Texas when banning on abortions.
Gavin Newsom, California Governor, announced on Saturday that they intended to restrict the sale and production of some sorts of guns in the most populated American state, with the help of the law mechanism used by Texas when approving the controversal ban on abortion made after detecting embroy's heart beat.
People would be then entitled to a compensation when taking legal steps against anyone who produce or sell assault rifles and homemade firearms.
Newsoma's announcement was a reaction to Friday's statement of the US Supreme Court which made Texas ban on abortion valid, although it's been against almost 50-year-old precedent that set out the right to abortion throughout the U.S. up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide whether the law was constitutional, but just a technical view of it, which arises from an innovative construction of the regulation.
The ban enforcement has been transferred to the public in this case, so Texas Republicans have made it impossible to be contested before the court of law.
“I'm outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the US Supreme Court which didn't abolish Texas ban on most abortions and supported Texas greatly in their aim to protect their law,” California Governor said.
“If states can now block reviews of their laws by federal courts, then California will give such an authority for human lives protection,” Newsom continues.
He said that he had charged his staff, while cooperating with the state parliament and the Ministry of Defense, work out a measurement which would make possible public representatives enforce a ban on assault rifles and the so-called ghost guns.
That means homemade guns which have no serial numbers and can be used in order to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants that “private citizens” would have the right to ask for a compensation at least in the amount of 10,000 dollars (more that 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone in California who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, “ghost gun” parts or kits for their production.
“If that's the most efficient solution how we can keep those terrible guns out of our streets, that means the threat of private prosecutions, then it's just the right thing that we should do,” California Governor said.
AP agency points out that California imposed a ban on the production and sale of some sorts of army-type guns for a few decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
In case that the state really imposed a ban again, using Texas template, then it would be the confirmation of what Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal member of the Supreme Court, who in a disapproving reaction to the majority court Friday's decision warned against the spread of the existing law mechanism in other American states,stated.
However, the Supreme Court did not give Texas ban on abortion a full immunity against court reviews and enabled abortion hospitals keep on taking legal steps against a few officials in the southern American state.
Every emergency vaccination has a testing period during which they step by step get to know what the vaccination scheme will look like and also vaccines are being improved at the same time, based on results.
E.g., there have been many studies on the effects of 4th dose from Israel.
And according those studies, the dose has boosted up antibodies five-fold at most patients, which has a long-term effect, as you mentioned.
It's just the same as any other vaccination and there will be a vaccination schema after some time, it's just too soon now.
Another fact is that there will be launched a new vaccine on the market in a short time, based on inactivated virus, which should be 10x times more effective, according to the manufacturer's promises.

How can I watch the Champions League online legally?
Do you know if there's any online service here in the Czech Republic that would enable me watch the Champions League for a fee?
We've got Netbox at home and I pay for a package of sports channels Telly to watch the Spanish and British football Champions League.
However, it doesn't include the UEFA.
I think that O2 offers watching the Champions League, but I don't want to change the television and Internet provider.
Poland threatens they would suspend payments in EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against law in case if it used the new power and stop funding to Poland because of the legal dispute.
The Commission has postponed the approval of the Polish intention of receiving 36 billion eur from the EU budget to renew its economy impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
And it has been under the European Parliament pressure to move towards and use a mechanism enabling stop the EU subsidies to countries which violate the principles of a legal state.
“Poland should reply to this blackmailing by the EU and use a veto in all matters which need to be approved by all countries,” Ziobro, leader of Solidární Polsko, which is very important for the current government's decision makings, said.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which has caused a drastic increase of energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will insist that Poland will suspend its payments in the EU budget.
That would be justifiable regarding the fact that the EU has unlawfully denied that we receive funding from the EU budget, in which we also sent payments, the Polish minister added.
Regarding the EU, his party has a more radical opinion than the ruling party Právo a spravedlnost.
According to the European Commission, the changes that have been made to the Polish justice during Ziobro performance have been a threat to its independence and it has been influenced by politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels has set “unrealizable conditions, as their aim is not a legal state, but establish of a new government in Poland”.
Warsaw has faced a “political dictate made via blackmailing and an effort to undermine democratic decision of a few millions of the Polish”, Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such a EU that would be based on sovereign states partnership, and not on ruling of the most powerful ones and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not democratic.
He said that his party will never accept such compromises of Brussels that would reduce the sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree with that Poland would be just a colony,” he stated.
But how can one knows anything about it... in nearby Lidl, they sell one kind of cheese at four different places.
I wasn't looking for other products, I saw a yogurt a few times, I just needed a piece of cheese, Parmesan, after ten minutes which I spent at the shelves with dairy products, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's truth, there was almost no one left at the narrow section, less common and special cheese, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free products section...
If possible, I won't go to any supermarket any more, whatever sales they would have, I will go to a shop at the square, they don't have such a wide range of products, for sure, but they usually have everything what I need and it's well-arranged, so I can do the shopping in ten minutes.
If I went to Lidl, I would have to take a day off.
And I don't care any more.
I've been watching for two years how data have been treated, most vaccination opponents are just a little bit out of the picture than most vaccination supporters.
There are some intellectual discussions, however, there are only released extreme opinions.
It's a wall-to-wall carpet.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is good for nothing.
Everything should be banned, everything should be allowed.
Sweet cakes instead of big analysis.
Comparing apples and pears.
This state does it in that way and so do we.
But no one matters that the method of data collection is different in those two states.
Ugh, I've vented my feelings.
I'm sorry for this comment and wish you have a nice day.
I was spanked by a wooden spoon as a child.
It was never because of grades I got at school, it was usually because I repeatedly refused to obey and I was naughty (I read instead of going to bed, I fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without being warned before, Mom always warned me at first that if I did it once again, I'll be spanked (she sometimes even just brought a wooden spoon after “having caught” me and put it the way I could see it).
Only then I continued on being naughty, I was spanked a bit (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (to a reasonable extent) are good as it's much more effective than words.
According to me, it's important to warn a child before spanking, because a child can choose then if it's obedient or not and will be spanked, or if it behaves better and there will be no punishment.
As for me, my parents usually just warned me and I was obedient finally.
System protection
When an important Czech lawyer and constitution judge Vojtěch Cepl answered in 1999 to a journalist's question what the Czech Constitution means for him – whether a sacred document to swear on and about which children are taught at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement which can be amended if necessary, he definitely chose the first option.
Once democratic principles of our lives have been set out by the Constitution which at the same time define who we as a state and its people are, and there is no need for many changes.
And imagine: some nations even love they regulations.
Just as Czech people love dumplings with roasted pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl replied to that question.
However, some lawyers started to believe lately that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
Over the past years, it has been tested by situations which its authors (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, e.g. the directly elected President's attitudes.
However, Cepl was right about one thing.
All that we know about such documents shows that political intervention in its contents need to be considered.
We need to understand and protect the Constitution, only then it can be the key to manage most crisis which have always happened in societies.
The Constitution is, among others, a kind of a set of rules which consists of individual regulations which set limits to politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused towards minorities or individuals, so that's why we limit politicians by bans.
But at the same time, the Constitution also enables that politicians have some power.
Covid do not choose, even a few-month-old babies fight for life in faculty hospital in Brno
Although children usually have mild symptoms of coronavirus, some of them might have, anyway, much more serious symptoms, which hospitals have been struggling with lately.
“We know that children are threatened and impacted less than adult people, it's estimated between 2 and 5 per cents compared to adults,” Petr Dominik, the chief of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, the University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, said to Novinky.
The symptoms are usually very mild and there are often no symptoms.
But there are small patients who have much more serious symptoms of the coronavirus, which has been obvious lately,” Dominik added.
According to doctors, that includes tens of children who need intensive care.
They are treated in the department of child infectious diseases.
There have been more children with very serious symptoms in ICUs lately.
Children with post-covid syndrome have been in the department continuously within the whole year.
“There have been more cases of children with covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia and that those children have to stay in resuscitation beds,” he said and added that this disease is infectious for both adult people as teenagers and also a few-month-old babies.
There are also children in very bad conditions because of the coronavirus in hospitals.
“At the moment, we have both a few-month-old baby and a teenager here,” the medical chief said.
However, he is happy that so far, no child has died of the coronavirus in the faculty hospital for children in Brno.
Based on surveys, six children of the age between 0 - 14 have died in the Czech Republic by December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is a necessary part – not only in the coronavirus department – of their work in hospital.
He also points out that both adults and children have very mild symptoms in case they have been vaccinated and there are less cases of post-covid syndrome at the same time.
“That's why we recommend that also children should be vaccinated,” the physician added.
In a quiet zone, you are only allowed to walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't much big.
You can see them on a tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere outside quiet zones in netaional parks (but don't climb over the fence into the game forest).
You aren't allowed to ski/ride a bike outside marked paths in the forest unless you've got a dispensation (but, of course, it's not much monitored outside national parks).
How does a musical conductor train?
I can hear music in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was educated in Liberec opera and he originally played the French horn.
As an opera singer, he can sing almost all repertory, and as a musical conductor, he performs not only in F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also e.g. in J.K.Tyl Theatre, in Pilsen.
He cooperates with the symphonic orchestra in Hradec Králové, the movie philharmonic or the symphonic orchestra in Krkonoše.
China appears to manage infection and that authoritarian regime faces crisis easily
Sinologist Jirouš: China appears to manage the infection and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis easily.
China has started health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism that they did not manage to stop the spread of the infection which turned in a global pandemic.
At the moment, countries are reporting no new disease cases.
States including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective aids and Chinese physicians help fight with COVID-19 in many countries, e.g. in Italy where the situation is the worst.
How should we perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is that a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve their world image?
A man meets a friend of him and tells him: Listen, would you like an elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
My wife likes it because it eats grass, it washes the car with its trunk, the children plays with it.
Just amazing.
I could sell it to you for 5000,- crowns.
The friend: Ok then, agreed, that will be great...
After some time, they meet again and the man who bought the elephant complains: Holy shit, what kind of elephant did you sell to me????
The grass is damaged, there are big shits everywhere, the children are afraid of it and my wife wants to divorce with me.
The other one says: You shouldn't talk about the elephant like that, or you won't sell it...
Global events are controlled by world powers.
Although independent states are equal, world powers control global events.
Europe only could become a world power if it improves its integrity.
So far, it's been existing at economic and political level (at some points), however, a military integrity has been missing.
Personally, I think that Europe has aimed at federalization.
It won't happen in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But let's say in the middle of the century, there will be different circumstances and that will happen.
I also had such an idea and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech language, so I may be word-splitting.
I just know that en ellipse usually includes 2 different units which are at the same level.
I will quote another example, in a sentence “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, it's clear to everyone that both are of Spanish origin, while in a sentence “Spanish fruit and tangerines” it's not evident if tangerines come from Spain.
Moreover, the sentence is “of all American troops”, that means including their weapons and I know that American premises are only operated by the Americans.
In other words, I expect that it's included in it in the term of wide comprehension and we don't have to specify that any more as for the American troops.
But again, I may be just word-splitting. :D
Either way, that request makes no sense.
Earthquake of magnitude 5 strikes Tokyo.
The capital city of Japan, Tokyo, and surrounding areas were stroke by an earthquake of magnitude 5 on Sunday.
Witnesses reported that the capital city buildings were trembling, however there have not been reported any damages so far.
There was not even issued any alert against tsunami, as Reuters informed.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured pygmy marmoset called Milly
Terrifying videos show the moment when the scared monkey had been crouching in the toilet bowl before her cruel owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebab and hamburgers, regardless her real food needs.
She has been banned for life from keeping any animals by the Municipality Court in Gwent, The Sun reported.
Experts on monkey rehabilitation who takes care after tortured Milly said that they never had seen so scared pygmy marmoset.
Milly rehabilitated at Monkey World in Dorset for almost two years and now she is happy playing again with another saved monkey called Moon.
The mother of four children confessed to two accusations of a protected animal torture.
She has been given a 12-week suspended sentence for one year by the Municipal Court in Gwent.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, she has been banned for life from keeping animals and she has to pay penalty of 12,000 crowns for court costs.”
The Small Monkeys team leader Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the tortured animal, said: “Milly is doing well, but we will continue in rehabilitations.”
Milly needed some time to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid whenever she saw anyone or heard any loud noise or sudden movement made her cry.
The small monkey also refused to eat and drink for a long time.
Even now, whe she is happy again, living together with a male, she may panic when she sees new people.
She will have some panic attacks forever, Sawyer adds.
The torture of Milly came to light after the police of Gwent had found terrifying videos in the woman's mobile phone after a raid in her flat because of the accusation of keeping drugs.
We can hear how the woman is swearing Milly vulgarly.
Next video shows how Holland is offering cocaine to the monkey and saying: “Do you want coke?”
So lick my fingers then.
In May, she and her boyfriend Russell Cox (43) confessed to keeping cocaine, which they intended to sell.
The police found cocaine for 1,600 pounds (almost 50 thousand crowns) in her house, which was hidden in Kinder Eggs.
After that, Cox was imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistory three times subsequently if you go bravely through the 20th century?
Do you mean that you will get the same things when you attend either the 1st grade or 6th grade?
And that all is killed by the idea of boning up, and nobody is concerned, with a few holy exceptions, if you know or understand that.
You have to pass a test at first and then no one is concerned.
Go out and ask some people at random if they manage to determine the roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients.
Everyone got through it, and most of them don't get a look in and they tell you that it's all completely fucked.
So why the fuck they learn that for?
I'm a great fan of general knowledge and the reality is that people don't want to and they don't need to.
And it's just wasting of time at that moment and you will never get that from them.
Partly they teach the plenty of people who won't need that.
But as for the note that you don't need that at all while working with a machine, I meant that quite seriously... because you just don't need that.
Moreover, the times have changed and it's a sign of decadency if you don't know anything.
(Which is probably also partly due to communism, which was a part of our history, and discrediting of educated persons and elites) However, we will pay much if there will be barbarians working with the machines.
For example, if journalists could count, then covid would never reach such dimensions.
Married at first sight: war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why why he can't leave Switzerland immediately” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions of her fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to break up with him and even block him in all social networks.
There were disputes between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and he thought that Andrea would move there to be with him, until he returns to the Czech Republic.
But she definitely refused.
And as we can see, their relationship was not a happy ending, but it rather escalated in mutual contempt or even hatred.
You'd planned that! Kadri replied angrily when Andrea accused him of lying, gambling and getting into debts.
Even Linda, Kadri's younger sister, did not like Kadri's ex-wife confess.
She decided to stand up for her brother openly.
I don't usually give my opinion on such matters at all and also in my family, we had never spoken about such things.
Certainly, that's not my intention to make anyone regret.
However, if I see anyone who openly tries to hurt and malign one of my close ones, then I express my attitude!
I'm sorry that I must do that in such a way, but I'd like to take this opportunity and thank my brother Kadri how he helped our family when we did need his help, even though he was so young at that time.
So I feel really sorry to read such untrue information, which has probably been out of context.
I wish so much that everyone could get to know Kadri just as I know him, our relatives and family, she responded to Andrea's words.
I'm really so much grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what media say, but the most important is that we, his family, love him very much and that we know what the truth is, she added indefinitely.
Drunk thief climbed facade to fifth floor.
You will not believe why he did it.
Cchao started his plundering intention at the car park in a residential district where he tried to burgle into a few cars.
As reported, he finally stole almost 330 crowns from one of the cars.
After that, he had an idea of climbing to the 5th floor and breaking into a flat through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the safety cameras caught him when he was leaving the scene down the street while eating a banana.
When the flat owner woke up next morning, he found out that the bananas had disappeared, and called the police.
Cchao was arrested by them.
The man confessed that he drank some alcohol that day.
And because he needed money, he decided to steal anything while being drunk.
The crime is being investigated.
A drunk man climbed the facade to the fifth floor and stole bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and its effectiveness is related to pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
The scope of business is limited by the law.
Isn't that a good reason for you?
Freedom of assembly will be restricted, but it won't be cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think that you know very well everything what people write to you here.
You just pretend to be a silly one so that you could “argue” with anyone.
If not, then it's sad.
I don't say that the Christians are degenerated, nothing like that.
On the contrary, I quite like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, in fact, was their purpose to look nice).
And I don't quite care who is a believer.
On the other hand, I don't like what great power the Church used to have in the Middle Ages, how much money it took from people, that it restricted science etc.
Not to mention all those wars which it caused, e.g. the Thirty Year's War.
Tl;dr: you can believe in a spaghetti monster, for all I care, but the state and the church don't match together.
Man falls upside-down from height of twelve metres.
He survives the crash into the pavement.
A man survived falling down like by magic in Ostrava on Sunday night, regional paramedics arrived and treated him.
An hour after Saturday's midnight, regional switchboard centre's staff answered an emergency call informing them that a man fell down from a height.
Two teams of rescue workers - paramedics and physicians - went to the scene immediately.
After their arrival, they could see that the 27-year-old man was supposed to fell upside-down from a height of twelve metres and crashed the pavement!
Coal caught fire in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, so a fire brigade was sent there.
Once they arrived, the man was unconscious, had many wounds and was in direct danger to life.
Paramedic on duty intubated the man's airways, provided him mechanical ventilation and after giving him pre-hospital emergency care, the man was taken by an ambulance to the trauma center in Ostrava hospital, as Lukáš Humpl, the spokesman of ZZS MS region, informed.
I am much more afraid of inadequate reactions of public and authorities rather than of the coronavirus.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officers, but those are mainly physicians and medical staff who have been on the frontline when fighting with the infection.
How much is the situation serious from their points of view?
We are asking army physician David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes defeated after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of amazing results.
There were happening things during the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňa was able to defeat legendary female wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not been defeated for seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira did not hesitate, he performed an excellent choke on Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Also Kai Kara-France won when he quickly overcame Cody Garbrandt by a technical KO in the first turn.
Also Sean O'Malley defeated his opponent.
That was a surprise that no one had expected.
That was a female bantam weight wrest between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňa.
The American entered the tournament as an imaginary “dwarf”, as Nunes was not defeated for seven years and she intended to reach a new triumph.
The beginning of the duel was happening just as it had been predicted.
Nunes started her way to the victory in a very acctive way and she gave her opponent push kick, by which she was sent down.
However, Peňa did not allow to be forced make another mistake and she tried to attack by armbar.
The second turn was amazing and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both opponents gave one another many excellent strikes and hooks.
Besides, Peňa back mounted Nunes where she started to choke her.
She had to resign and replay the attack.
The American prepared a big shock to everyone when she became the champion.
The top of the gala evening was a duel between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight championship.
At first, Poirier was luckier, however, there was a break soon.
In the second turn, Oliveira tried to be more active and defeat the opponent by armbar.
He was not much successful, however, then he made a great pressure, back mounted his opponent and gave him a series of hits.
He won the second turn as a result.
In the third turn, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to replay the attack.
The Brazilian retained the title, Poirier was, on the contrary, defeated after two years.
In the next tournament, Sean O'Malley was a definite winner when he gave Raulian Paiva a hard guillotine in the first turn.
Then he finished by series of direct hits and reached the 15th triumph.
Kara-France then defeated Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes reached another triumph with her small daughter, who was defeated after seven years.
Hip joint - masculinum or femininum?
At first sight, it's nothing difficult.
Most similar nouns in Czech language only have one gender, and thus it's not difficult to determine whether it's a masculinum or a femininum or a neutrum.
However, there is quite a big group of nouns that might have more genders.
Such nouns have both genders.
They have both masculinum and femininum suffixes while being declined and some of them can't be even declined.
For example, words “trouble” or “hip joint” can be both a masculinum and femininum, in the first case, they are declined according to the example word “machine”, in the second case according to the example word “song”.
Another group of nouns include different forms in the 1st grammatical case in singular, e.g.: “řádek/řádka”, “kedluben/kedlubna” or “brambor/brambora” (food).
Both forms are standard, they have got the same meaning and they can be used voluntarily.
There might be slight differences in word meanings depending on a region, e.g. “okurka” in Bohemia and “okurek” in Moravia, however in this case, the Moravian word is informal, there are some more similar words in Bohemian and Moravian forms: “příkop” and “příkopa”, “kobliha” and “koblih” etc.
Some words which were taken from other languages were not originally declined, however, they've started to take Czech suffixes.
A typical example is word “image” which have both gender, masculinum and femininum, or word “bufet” which is not declined in neutrum but has sufixes in masculinum according to the example word “castle”.
Turkey opened gate for immigrants into Europe.
What is the situation like just at the Greek border?
There has been tension at the Greek-Turkish border because of an increasing number of immigrants who are trying to enter Europe.
Thousands of people have set out to the southern border of Schengen after Ancara stopped keeping them from doing that.
European politicians have promised to help Greece, also the Czech government is going to provide humanitarian aid.
What are the immigrants motivated with?
And what is the situation like just on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and suffocated, a journalist from Sydney describes.
Almost thirty people and hundreds of millions animals have been killed and a few million hectares of the ground have been devastated during devastating fires that Australia has been fighting with for four months yet.
How do local people and authorities overcome such a disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent far-reaching impacts, as their critics say?
And what should the country be prepared for in the future if there will be more climate changes?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaking with Ika Detrich, a journalist from Sydney.
There have always been frames and they're quite rare.
That's why they write about each of them everywhere.
People don't like solving sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they avoid talking about it.
Personally, I don't know anyone who has been framed.
But I know many people who were raped and I could see how other people or the police treated the victims.
We should always believe victims.
Nowadays, victims have started to talk about their traumas finally.
Still, many people don't tell anyone.
Yes, there are some people who are able to frame someone.
That's awful and depreciation of sexual violence victims, but if you say that “most accusations are frames” and that it's “trendy” you only help sexual rapists.
More and more unfinished family houses in Czech Republic, families lack of money
Prices of building materials have increased more than by 30 per cent over the past weeks.
Many people have had troubles because of that.
They do not have money to finish the building of their family houses and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
Except for material prices, prices of building works have also increased.
That's why people do not have lots of money to finish the building of their family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which makes them troubles.
In better case, people move to unfinished and non-approved houses.
In worse case, they cannot live in their unfinished houses and families have to sell them, as they cannot afford paying both mortgages and rents,” Štěpán Křeček, BHS economist, says.
We build two or three family houses per year, and fifty per cent of them are those cases.
As we're a building company, it's difficult for us, because we are bound by contracts, although prices of materials have increased.
So we work without making profit,” Zdeněk Slivoň, a building company owner, says.
Many people will have financial trouble in the near future.
If they had a budget of five million crowns for building their houses, it will cost seven million now.
I think that some of them will be postponing,” Slivoň added.
Currently, the most expensive materials have been copper, iron and also plumber and heating equipment.
Another problem that building companies have faced is lack of staff.
There is a lack of construction field graduates in the Czech Republic and foreign workers cannot work here due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Only the issuing of building permits have improved lately.
“Building offices issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost by 10 per cent more than last year,” Křeček added.
We are fine and we will be even more fine.
However, any real vision is missing, as a ČRO – mujRozhlas broadcaster says.
The new year's entrance was, except for traditional celebrations, accompanied by speeches of politicians.
This year, not only Prime Minister and leader of ANO party Andrej Babiš ans President Miloš Zeman, but also chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What is the most important thing that they told us?
That's why a diploma thesis seems to be great to me, I've chosen my own topic, I follow up with my bachelor thesis, I always work on it the whole year and then I make a written part in 1 or 2 weeks.
Final examinations are no trouble, if one isn't stupid and remembers something, the committee will not make it hot in theory.
As for me, I prepared for the examinations for a week and when I didn't know what else, the committee always tried to help me find any logical connection, which I found and that was correct.
When speaking about the projects, I know a few people who pay someone who makes the project for them (we've done that many times, very helpful, indeed, you can learn a lot), and then they just learn the project and they're gonna be set.
In my opinion, it's great that every subject is finished by a test which shows your knowledge that you get from the project, not only defending a thesis.
Everything's all right, but do not send plenty of e-mails and phone calls and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same mother-fucker as them.
The people at the embassy might have nothing to do with that.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a huge risk, so they may be on their side, or anything might happen.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie-the-Pooh.
And you can put it in a way that it would reach Xi Jinping's ass or so.
I agree, even though Insta throws artists curve balls.
Once you don't add stories every day and a new picture at least every other day, ranges will decrease to minimum.
Furthermore, it's been often changed what function is the most important, whether a like, comment or save.
It's pissed me off so much lately, so I may have to lower to tiktok, where many artists in my business are successful and they won't hear a word against it.
Finally I'd be maybe glad if there were something more user friendly what doesn't draw creativity and energy from artists.
Donbas Worker's Party statement
Union – yes, break – no, opponents of the USSR dissolution in the picture expressed their opinion.
Thirty years after the illegal USSR dissolution.
On December the 8th 1991, the biggest geopolitical disaster ever happened.
On December 8th, in Bialowieza Forest, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, with no legal power and violating the results of the referendum held on March 17th 1991, with an open benevolent attitude of Michail S. Gorbačov, in secret, regardless people, signed an agreement that “the USSR no more exists as an international law subject and geopolitical reality”.
Just by one deletion, they “cancelled” a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
After the USSR dissolution, tens of millions of ethincally Russian inhabitants stayed abroad.
Since early 90s, the Russian populations has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless the loss of non-Russian population of former USSR republics, we have lost more people than in both world wars altogether!
Earlier, the same people, who, during one session in Bialowieza Forest destroyed what had been built over the past seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created even at the cost of million of lives during the World War II and Great Patriotic War).
They willfully made deindustralisation, slowed down agriculture, lost fourteen republics that originally belonged to the biggest world power and formed a unique economic mechanism.
If we want to have a deeper look at it, then we can see people becoming poor, economy, science, army decline, decrease of crimes, ethnical conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-soviet world, series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and break of Yugoslavia, Arab spring, the war in Syria – those all are results of geopolitical capitulation, waiver of the socialist camp at first and then the USSR.
In politology, there is a term called “vacuum of power”.
Everything, which was betrayed and left in a hurry, was quickly occupied and conquered by the countries of NATO, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world has been shaken up to now mainly because of events which happened at the end of 80s and in early 90s of the 20th century.
The price of a product which is sold at the supermarket at a huge profit doesn't have to correspond to its quality.
It's Monday and at the supermarket, they've got some meat which costs 189,00 CZK / kg.
I buy it and put it in the fridge and want to cook if for dinner on Thursday.
In alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the price will be reduced to 99,00 CZK / kg - describe me the mechanism which will make the meat hard for my digestive system by changing the price of the meat?
Or I wait till Thursday and the price of the meat will be reduced to 69,00 CZK / kg 1 day before its expiry date - by which the meat would differ from what I'd bought on Monday by 120,00 CZK more expensive and left it for 3 days in my fridge?
I'll reply myself - by nothing.
Those bullshit about that if anything is cheap, it's for sure of poor quality, bad or rotten, they're quite stupid, to tell you the truth ;-)
A short time ago, I went to the main station in Brno and a few young girls were giving a brochure in a subway, I usually take such things so that I could help temporary workers, they can't just throw anything away...
Well, the brochure was about common sense and conservative points of view on the world, but there was nothing about the God, I was confused but I had a feeling that it was a kind of campaigning.
After reading that, I found the editor of the brochure and finally I found out that it was the Church of Scientology.
Well, it was not so bad, full of useless propositions, such as I should wash myself and not behave like a moron.
Just a wasting of paper, there's no point in cutting forests because of making anything like that.
I had a similar experience with my former girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to satisfy that person, because you like them and you don't realise what a nervous wreck they are.
She threatened me with hurting herself a few times, just because I went to a pub with a friend of mine who she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to left her flat earlier, she started to cry and asked me being on her knees not to leave.
Then she started to block the door.
Our relation was great for about a year, but after another six months, she became insane.
Then I broke up with her and told her that I was leaving her and that we could have a chat about it later just to calm her so that she didn't get a new nervous attack.
Such a person draws your feeling, emotions and happiness in general.
It's better stay away.
When insurance companies have been stolen by buying billions of tests, and then they quickly urge on positive ones who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease without being tested.
The only thing we've reached is a complication for companies, transport agents and others, just because their employees were accidentally chosen to be isolated at their homes for five days.
They've stopped doing that in western counties and admitted that there's no point in solving a disease which isn't as serious as the flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new there and has to steal something and chase his ego by bullying up.
I see a good old rubbish has returned.
After a few years of slow-down and oppression of that fishy business, MLM recruiting has come back in the glory.
I was one of recruits, I tried the job (I was about 20, 1st university grade), instead of initial promises about product training and business skills they finally said “do not care, just make business”.
I was sincerely interested in products I offered as I wanted to help people, anyway the purpose of those trainings was rather about how to frighten and talk people round.
When I got my first salary, I realised quickly that if I want to earn money, I only have to offer a few certain products per month.
Only investment life insurance and mortgages were profitable, so I could feel like a door-to-door seller of pots finally.
But what I can say is that it was very good experience, I learned that one couldn't take the first job and they must get some information before.
At the same time, I wouldn't judge all of them.
There are successful people doing such business and they even bring benefits to other people, but for sure, they won't boast about expensive consumables or having a “fat” bank account.
I haven't had such experience in the corporation I work for.
HR is all right, managers are in charge of management and don't mind our business.
There's some regular rating, the way it's done is not so bad (you set some targets for the next year and then we'll have a look at your successes and failures) - it's rather a self-evaluation, not that anyone evaluates you according to some figures, etc.
Company events aren't obligatory as well.
But we're a bit specific within the company - there are departments which are more “corporate”.
One has sometimes a feeling that we're a kind of a start-up that squats in offices of a big corporation.
But that works fine, so they don't care about us until there are results of our work.
Missing Czech woman in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
The British police searched with no results for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.

She was also in the Czech database of missing people.
The police arrested a man a few days ago.
However, they did not give any information about what the reason for his arrest was and what the man is suspected of.

There were held four new or repeated municipal elections and particularly carefully monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work under hard conditions due to the coronavirus pandemic, so it was more difficult as for technical equipment and staff, Eva Krumpová, the 1st Vice-chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last election district results were processed on Sunday December 12th, 3:49AM.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the National Electorial Commission and after their approving, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem that I've had with the whole pandemic.
Tu put up with the fact that there has appeared quite a dangerous illness, that took me a while at the very beginning, but I could accept it quite easily.
Tu put up with the fact how stupidly most of the population from all social classes have faced the problem, that's much harder to me.
I'm looking (tomorrow!) for vaccination the most because thanks to it I'll be finally less dependable on the fact that other people aren't idiots.
He was deprived from the president position and isn't allowed to get it again.
The chance that he will be successful is really very small, as others comment here.
Besides, I'm not sure if shredding files could be considered as a high treason at all.
I high treason is such an act by which a president of a country puts in danger the state sovereignty, territory integrity or democratic principles.
It would have to be something more serious.
How pandemic has influenced intimate lives: increasing number of people by age 35 without having sex whole year
More and more young people in the US are living without having sex.
Those include mainly people who believe in God, DailyMail reports on their website.
The survey shows that the number of people by age 35 living without sex have increased from 8 to 21 percent between 2008 and 2021.
The number of women between age 18 and 35 who reported having no sex over the past year is still increasing.
According to survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS), the decreasing number of sexually active people is also influenced by other circumstances.
One of them may be economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
However, there might be also the influence of media, social networks or video games, which are for young people more important than sex.
“Since 2010, the number of men and women between age 18 and 35 who report having no sex for more than one year has been increasing quickly,” IFS researcher Lyman Stone said.
Married people have sex more frequently, only 5% of them reported having no sex in 2021.
As for single people, it was 29%. Stone added that there was only a small percentage of young people by age 35 who were married.
Less sexual activity may also be influenced by fear from premarital sex and religious motivation.
Although married people are supposed to be more sexually active, the percentage of married people by age 35 has been decreasing.
Young people have different opinions on premarital sex, about 30% consider it unacceptable, while ca 70 % think that it is, on the contrary, acceptable.
“It is truth that there are not many of them within their age category of single people, but their behaviour has been changing this trend,” Stone speaks about those three percent.
Most people who have the moral case for premarital sex believe in God.
Since 2008, the number of young people under age 35 who participate in religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among people who “believe less”, the number has increased from 10 to 20 %,” Stone said.
The decrease in sexual activities may be also influenced by other factors, for instance less social interactions and mainly drinking alcohol during the pandemic crisis.
The survey has also shown that unemployed people or people who earn less money are more probable to have no or little sex.
Another reason may be more availability of digital media, which probably cause that people do not need to have much sex.
People spend more time online, which they prefer “doing” instead of having sex.
This trend has spread mainly during the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns.
Obligatory vaccination against covid is problematic as the society would force a part of the population doing what they don't want to do, anyway that might save their lives.
It's quite a difficult question, and I personally have a problem with the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't force them to do that and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that it would be surely our fault if an 80-year-old person who didn't know much about it died, we didn't explain that to them, they got some misinformation, and for those reasons they weren't vaccinated and finally became ill and died.
On the contrary, I don't think that it would be our fault if a stubborn vaccine opponent, who just like SPD and KSČ yell about bullying and a totalitarian state, died.
As we can see from the above mentioned statistics, we can say definitely that most of old pensioners who aren't vaccinated probably belong to the other group, so they cause problems for themselves.
No snow in the Czech Republic.
How will a mild winter influence the fight with drought?
This year, there has been very little snow in the Czech Republic ever.
Ski resort owners have to use technical snow, also preparation of Jizerská padesátka has been complicated by the weather.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And how will so little snow influence the fight with drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about religionists.
One day, when I attended high school, our teacher took us throughout the whole town to the dock to go by boat on the river.
On our way there, we went through a wide street and suddenly we see a person in the middle of the street - a supporter of Hare Krishna.
Of course, they came to us.
I was lucky to escape them, but a friend of mine talked to them.
When she left, I and our teacher asked her what she was saying to them.
“They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I replied I had no soul,” she said.
Everyone, including our teacher, was laughing till the end of our way to the dock.
We are spoiled so much.
The situation is not so bad, but the system has been collapsing, Orozovič says.
On Sunday, after visiting Paris and Brusel, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw, where he was welcomed with military honours by the Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We're starting a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after their negotiations.
Scholz pointed out that Europe have to demonstrate jointly that they will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the alarming movement of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border has, in the Chancellor's opinion, to be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including the “Normandry group” unifying France, German, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, the leader of which Alexandr Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and use people like hard targets and weapons, because we have noticed hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally every night.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about other sanctions so that Lukashenko regime and his patrons in Kreml would realise finally that we are determined to defend the EU eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw is supported by Germany in their dispute with Belarus, and he condemned inhuman treatment of refugees by Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun causes car crash, trying to conceal
The car returned to the accident scene after a while, however, it was driven by another nun, who tried to take responsibility for herself.
When the police told her that her driving licence could still be revoked for not giving priority to other vehicles and leaving the accident scene, she told them the truth, as TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the car was crashed by the other nun, who asked her for help.
The police went to arrest sister Celestine after that.
She had to take a breath test and after they found out that she had had more than two per mille in her blood, her driving licence was revoked immediately.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess before the court of law.
Dog Hugo does his best
However, Juraj Šajmovič did not master his movie.
Czech authors of family comedies took American pet dog stories as samples.
But they forgot one important thing: the rules of movie industry.
After cheesy movie Gump - pes, který naučil lidi žít by F. Brabec, a new movie Tady hlídáme my has appeared to attract people.
Juraj Šajmovič ml., who is both its author and director, has followed slightly his previous movie Tady hlídám made in 2012.
Again, we can see speaking dachshund Hugo and some other famous characters.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a declining guest house in Šumava, start inviting dog owners, Julia's father with his girlfriend and mainly her daughter Veronika.
She is not a small girl, but a teenager, falling in love for the first time.
The director and his girlfriend Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is the movie producer) had already trouble with dialogues in the previous movie, however the children and the dog were amusing at least there.
They wrote even a worse screenplay this time, which makes feelings of astonishment and awkwardness.
Let's summarize.
Julie, although she is a researcher, want to have a baby so much that she believes guffs and during the right “constellation”, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan anywhere possible – on a car bonnet or in a church tower (during an excursion with a local guide, of course), former colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter Julie despite his long-term experience, she falls into a coma and then she is taken with her family to hospital, and then she recovers miraculously thanks to a dog in Šumava.
Nothing against the healing power of the nature and pets.
Their owners know well why they keep them.
But a spectator is astonished about what unlikely situations and characters have been used to give them such a message.
A pair of female thieves from staff, the dog owners contest, a charlatan from Šumava, the police officers being called for and searching “drugs” and discussing about herbs and the healing power of bone meal – and which are being drunk by the clever guest house owner.
When the main female character wakes up after being in coma and suddanly, she sits with a new hair style and make-up at the family table, smoking a cigarette and asking for father's whisky and a piece of meat as she is no longer a vegetarian, then we cannot resist laughing.
Besides, the authors explain to spectators that it “sometimes happens after being in coma”.
Šajmovič team lack of basic knowledge of dramaturgical work with text, ability to create crucial situations, sense of characters and point and also the direction itself.
Actor performances are of different quality, the editing is unbalanced and the whole impression is unconvincing.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to act the best way, the screenplay is very weak.
The only positive thing of the movie is poetic images of Šumava nature made by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a couple od dachshunds.
It is not enough to describe a few characters, a weak plot and the dog's comments, let alone traditional swear words used by the characters.
A long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club is not an argument, too - which is the case of the producer.
If one, in good faith, intends to promote the nature and the friendship between human beings and dogs, they also should have to know their ropes if they want to tell a credible story.
Which is not the case of this movie.
There is too much erotics and a minimum feeling for the genre.
This amateur experiment wouldn't be even good as a canistherapy campaign.
Yes, respect, as they have to listen to insults from mother-fuckers like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, it shows that you know shit about it, but it's just because you've nevere tried that.
It's always customer who decides, if they don't want to, then the answer will always be no.
If you didn't listen to such rubbish all the time, then you might change your opinion.
They do the same work as anyone else, as for me, it's a temporary job.
Middle East suffer from extreme droughts.
Winter is, in fact, the only season during which it rains there.
“There was almost no rain in October, as we noticed at some weather stations, that's very unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service says.
For example, in November, there was only six percent of the long-term average precipitation in Kfar Giladi, a village located in the north of Israel.
So two-day lasting rain was rather an exception in this week.
That's good for us.
It's been long time since it rained here.
It's also the right Christmas atmosphere, Wasím Aškar from Nazareth smiled.
Rainfalls are common in Israel only during winter months, they are rare and not on a regular basis.
Forests are dependable on winter rainfalls.
Otherwise they get dry and there is a danger of fires.
But not only forests, also drinking water supplies and water used in agriculture is very important.
The Sea of Galilee, which is the biggest supply of drinking water in Israel, has filled up to its banks in spring thanks to the last three winters with heavy rainfalls.
However, its level has been declining since then.
Water management experts have warned against droughts ever since.
“We can expect that there will be less rainfalls, depending on the global warming and climate changes,” Uri Schor, the spokeswoman of the Israel Water Management Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
There is even a worse situation is in less developed countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
We can see more and more water tanks in the streets of Jordan, Amman.
Water pipes and private dwells have been drying out.
“This year, I've received by 70 - 80 per cent more orders compared to last two years,” Imád Sulejman, a tank vehicle driver, reported in September.
There were some clashes between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
A local river was completely without any water.
The region has suffered the driest October over the past years.
Israel preparing military strike on Iran
The Izraeli Minister of Defense said that there was no “results” after negotiations in Vienna and that he informed Washington about preparation of military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz sain on Saturday that he ordered Israeli army to increase their pressure on Iran, anyway he also informed Washington about military preparations.
Gantz, who is staying in the U.S.A., is trying to convince the Americans to step their efforts on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna had “no results” and the great powers “understand that the Iranians are taking chances with them”.
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I was giving a young woman a hard time a little bit to find out what exactly she wanted from me.
Finally I found out that my suspicion about the Pyramida was correct.
As I don't like such kind of tricks, I annoyed the girl with doubts and questions for a while and finally I thanked to her and left.
You could call me a bastard, but the Pyramida is what it is and financial consultants are all the same.
Skiers went to mountains at the weekend, there were both enough snow and nice weather.
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic welcomed first load of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowing at the end of the week, there is a lot of snow everywhere and some ski resorts opened thanks to that.
Skiers were not even discouraged when they had to show vaccination certificates at ski lifts.
While ski lift operators cannot complain about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental service report lower demand on their services than it used to be before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went also skiing in Liberecký Region at the weekend.
Skiers were lucky with the weather, it was sunny today and there were great conditions for skiing.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend was a real success since Friday when there were first people skiing in the mountains,” Jakub Hanuš, director of Ski Resort Ještěd, was happy.
Hundreds of people went also skiing in Jeseníky Mountains the first time in this season.
Ski resort Ski Aréna Karlov or Branná in Šumpersko opened as well.
Many people came, around 400,000 people came on Saturday and today, too.
There were great conditions.
It was sunny today, around three degrees below zero, so it was great, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of ski resort Branná, was happy.
Ski resort operators can sell ski passes only to those who have been vaccinated or if they had covid a short time ago.
With exceptions, people are prepared to it and they show required documents, René Hroneš from ski resort Špindlerův Mlýn told ČTK.
“There were only a few conflicts,” he added.
Some rental services and ski equipment shops report lower demand on ski equipment compared to the situation before the pandemic.
Luckily, people are interested in borrowing skis.
It's not the same as it used to be in the past, but we've still had enough customers, Alexandra Bokišová from shop Skiopava said.
They expect more people during ski courses.
Also David Šinták, the CEO of company Snowbear in Hradec Králové, thinks that people are less interested in borrowing ski equipment due to the coronavirus pandemic.
This time before the pandemic, most of our equipment had been borrowed by people.
It's less by about 50 % compared to the situation before the pandemic, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazier and they got used to staying at home.
On the contrary, rental service in ski resort Novako at Boží Dar report a huge demand.
They started lending ski equipment a week ago, and people have to order it in advance.
“We start to lend cross-country skis this weekend, but people called long time before, so we are expecting a great interest, just like last year,” Pavlína Nováková, the ski resort operator, said.
According to her, people are also still interested in ski training, which is the same as before the pandemic.
If we want to make sure that successful and wealthy people won't leave the country, they must have chances to live their lives of the same quality as abroad.
Which is not surely socialistic healthy service when one can't find a dentist or a medical specialist.
Smart and skillful people who aren't wealthy go abroad.
A company owner won't probably leave the country.
But I agree completely with other things.
If such people won't live quality lives in the Czech Republic and those people won't have a vision of a good future, then they won't stay in the Czech Republic.
People started to emigrate from Hungary after one day Orban had won elections, he ruled for one year and suddenly, the number of emigrants increased by a few tens of thousands per year.
We'd be naive if we thought that there couldn't be the same situation in the Czech Republic by the day.
Elections is another question.
If people don't have good conditions for living here, then one day, an insane might also win elections.
Young and educated people will leave the country, only his supporters will stay and then people who are too rich to quit with all their wealth.
Terryfying photo!
Langmajer covered with blood because of the bet on beer?
Being autumn under the way in the Czech Republic, the Ostrov movie crew with Jiří Langmajer (55) headed up were enjoying a tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor shared a picture of his face covered with blood on social networks.
Is the wound real, or is it just make-up because of making a movie?
London police still investigates missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra's missing is unlike her behaviour and we've started worrying about her very much,” Lucy O'Connor from Lambeth police department, where Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic have also much worried about her, and they just want to know where she is,” she added.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at 7:45PM on Sunday, October 28th, and went home to the district of Camberwell.
She was reported to be last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
One of her co-workers told the police about her missing on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a “nurse assistant” in Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital union Guy's and St Thomas'.
“We're so much worried about our dear co-worker Petra, who is missing,” the group of medical facilities wrote on Twitter.
“We'd like to appeal to anyone who could give any information that might help find her that they contact the police,” it was written in their post.
Also deputy Hariett Harman has called on the public when she talked about Srncová case during the press conference on Saturday.
“She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years, she comes from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, extremely worried about her,” the Labor Party's politician said while showing a picture of the woman, distributed by London police.
“It's my feeling that we all have a big responsibility and should try to find her, because she was out of her country, far from her family and worked for our health service,” Harman said.
In connection with the case, the police had earlier arrested a man who has still been kept in custody.
According to BBC web, the police have neither given any information concerning his identity nor what that man has been suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, surely not with just 30 BTG (that is about 5 divisions).
Not even me underestimates Ukraine like that.
That's not just a “huge amount”, but ca 8 per cent of the Russian army.
Just notice that Ukraine has repeated that we exaggerate the menace of an invasion and it's started to being fed up with our intervention.
I quoted that at the top.
I don't know why do you think that Russia wants a war.
A war is extremely expensive and Russia's GDP is at the same level as of Italy.
To compare the situation with the situation in 1938 is so much out of the picture that I don't even know with what I should start talking.
It's just as if I compared that with the 1st Punic War and “annexation” of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine had announced that it wouldn't meet the Minsk Agreement's, Russia will annex all those small states.
That's all I wanted to say, and that's what the “concentration” at the borders would respond to.
As they say, pacta sunt servanda...
New public transport timetables valid in Prague from Sunday, including mainly suburban transport
A few changes await Prague integrated transport (PID) passengers starting on Sunday, including mainly suburban transport.
New lines have been launched, some of them have been changed or even cancelled.
Mladoboleslavský Region has started to participate in the integrated system.

Healthy snack / lunch from supermarket in office
Hi, I work standard hours from 9-5 having a 30-minute break and I can only buy some food in Billa, which is next door, or Lidl, which is a bit farther.
Given that I don't have much exercise and after work, I'm to tired to do some, I must only eat healthy and diet food.
Unfortunately, I never know what I shall buy and as I'm in a hurry, I only buy some pizza buns and some yoghurt and an apple for snack.
Question: what healthy food which doesn't need to be cooked would you recommend me buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately, it's like that.
And not speaking about trees that you have to see necessarily.
There might be hidden just a top of a tree under snow.
If it's damaged, the tree might be predisposed to fungus disease.
I don't say it's just only reason why they don't allow us to ski outside the downhill, but it's one of them.
Dara confessed to her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to it at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbusiness world has been talking about nothing but disclosure of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Now Dara sent a long message to her fans, explaining why she concealed her love for such a long time.
“I can say that at the moment, there's no one both in the Czech and Slovak Republic who wouldn't know that Dara “hunted a bear”, or exactly, Nedvěd,” Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player, made a joke.
But she says it was him who picked her up.
They have been centre-stage for three days, and as they are both used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it comes.
Something we didn't look forward to, but we knew that it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's in a worse situation.
If those who aren't interested in it at all, but they can see and hear about us everywhere, or we whose lives are discussed in details openly.
As if anyone of you one wanted to hear if you and your boy- or girlfriend are a good couple, or if you insisted that everyone would have a list of your ex-partners and knew of all your mistakes and weaknesses.
That's really great, just what you want, Dara is annoyed.
The couple started their relationship in Italy where Dara came to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd was there as a long-term Juventus Vice-president.
They did not tell the truth about their relationship earlier, as they waited for Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana were separated for three years, however, they got divorced officially three weeks ago.
Anyway, we thank to those who are happy about us and wish that to us.
We're also only human, we've got our families, children past and also dreams.
We aren't perfect, but I think that we both have got hearts in the right places.
Also for that reason, I love my new boyfriend and I support him just as he supports me. For better or worse, Rolins said.
Hi, other commenters have said what they wanted to say, I just confirm that the halls of residence have been great since the beginning, my classmates usually met new people and made friends during the first semester and they found lodgings later, which is, in my opinion, the best solution, as you know who you will share a room with.
There aren't usually many adverts on flats in advance, so at the moment, you won't probably find any, anyway you can go through ads, it's worth it.
Make sure that you won't go to Cejl and the vicinity (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská etc., these places have a very bad reputation), and also some parts of Židenice are a bit like ghettos.
On the contrary, Veveří is popular with students, Královo pole and that direction is fine, and besides, it's close to most VUT colleges (I don't know in which you will be).
I've never looked for any lodgings, but I'm a native from Brno, so I can advise you if you need some more information :)
That's a very nice example of quite “normal” thinking.
Because a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do that, it's all right that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either they should teach what they want and pay for that themselves, or they should teach what the states says and it's paid by the state.
We can't still let a private partaker gain control over a part of the education system just because that there will be some more money to state funds and they could teach at schools whatever they want.
Such a claim is a bit weak if it's written by a person who talked like that about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state two days ago:
So if anyone has an abortion and you're against it, is it the same situation as if you were against building a statue on a square?
If I were you, I'd consult it directly with that person who gave the work to you.
Well, I had such experience while doing cataloging/digitalisation that (and even experts who have been doing that work for a long time) they either make an approximate estimate or note down something like xxx *** or ... (as usual) and they add a comment that it's not readable.
It's truth that in this case it's quite readable, so I wouldn't recommend that.
Personally, I'd probably make a comment, depending on what programme you use.
If you wanted to be a proper and hardworking student, you could go through some emblem databases and find out the most similar one.
But as if it looks like that you get information from a book, I'd bet that the author or printer simply made their own emblem which is similar to what's there on the coin.
PS: Isn't it Odryská Empire (Kingdom) rather than Odrynská Empire?
PSS: Someone has solved that here.
See the comment including ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't have a clue what the main “topic” of the Czech EU presidency will be.
That's much worse than the fact that they will take interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve anything as nobody understood their speech is funny.
All important documents to be approved are read word by word, one need to have excellent knowledge of English, that's in charge of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, politicians use English rather during informal negotiations, to get some more important contacts.
Besides, the situation about English is quite interesting at the moment, after the Brexit.
I don't understand the hate about Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I haven't had any troubles.
I often goes home at 10 PM and there have never been any problems.
Only person who has never been there can call it a ghetto.
Yes, most gypsy population of Brno live there, but they don't harm anyone, they just block pavements and park where it's not allowed :D But for sure, I'm not afraid to go there at night.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap lodgings with a good access to the center, then you should try that.
Many flats have been newly reconstructed or built there.
Felix Slováček (78) completely alone without Dáda and his mistress Gelemová!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people burnt the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I haven't any Advent wreath, so there was no candle to be burnt.
I saw Dáda's wreath and Lucie surely has some, too, the saxophonist said to Blesk, and thus he confirmed what Patrasová had said, that he often visited her.
He visits her, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady where Dada stayed alone after he left.
Slováček still does not know where he will spend Christmas Eve.
We met Anička, Felix and both grand-sons a short time ago.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we talked about something all the time, so we didn't speak about Christmas at all.
I don't really know, where I will be.
I buy gifts throughout the hole year and for sure, I will buy something for Dáda and Lucie, perhaps some perfumes.
I'm a gentelman, Felix, who came to Richman club to launch a new music video, said.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel lonely.
I always find someone who I can have a nice chat with, Slováček says, and he was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that absolutely clear.
Are we Iceland that we could afford not having any soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will be willing to defend us and we're located so strategically that an aggressor would be an idiot if they didn't occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, please try to explain to me.
I don't know any other service that could be used in crisis at hospitals.
We've got few police officers and they can't do that, of course, we've got many firefighters and there aren't so many skilled people who are able to provide medical services of such quality anywhere in the world.
And the fact that our army is able to defend maybe Ostrava and that's all, it's our previous governments' fault, they've been asking for new equipment since long.
Record-breaking drought in the CR.
It is necessary that we change donations to agriculture, the landscape is not just a factory for manufacturing food, a journalist says.
There has been a record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic over the past years.
According to experts, there has been less water in mountains and submontane areas, and a small precipitation has affected even areas which have never suffered from droughts.
Thd reason for droughts that have been in most parts of central Europe is the climate change.
But there is another reason, too, the way we treat the earth.
What should we be prepared for when there are droughts?
And how can we help the nature in such difficult situations?
Yeah, that's it, I can't almost ice-skate, I don't know anything about ice-hockey and the tactics (which I tried to play in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also very weak.
And either you're an ice-hockey team “mědvěd Rusko” or “lama Čína”, it's different if you lose by two goals although you don't have to win a game necessarily, or if the game is tight.
But in all cases, as I listen to Czech broadcasters who points out what coaches notice or don't, either men' or women's ice-hockey, that's all strange, but it's probably same in every sport, the UEFA and “Italští herci” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There's controversy everywhere.
And if it were different, it would be as usual, and that the Czech Republic has been defeated by Russia more often than won, we could hear as usual “they lost” vs “WE won”.
Coronavirus: The number of infected people has reached 10 million in Russia.
On Saturday Dec 11th, there have been 9,080 new cases per day in the Czech Republic.
5,766 patients are in hospitals.
34,451 people died in total in the Czech Republic, other 74.
There have been 1,967 new confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the Czech Republic over last 14 days and 871 cases per 100,000 people over the last week.
On Sunday, the number of infected people has reached 10 million in Russia.
There have been reported 29,929 new cases over the last 24 hours.
That has been lowest number per day since October 13th.
The total number of reported cases has been 10,016,896 in Russia.
The number of deceased people is 1,132 per day, which has been the lowest number since the end of October.
Great Britain has faced an “inevitably” huge wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant, as doctor Susan Hopkins, the main medical consultant for the UK Health Security Agency, said on TV on Sunday.
Some new quarantine regulations will be necessary.
People infected by the Omicron variant have been taken to hospital in Great Britain and Hopkins expects that the number will increase.
So far, nobody has died of the Omicron variant, however people are sent to hospital in about 14 days after being infected and they die in about three weeks after being infected.
Keir Starmer, the leader of the British Labor Party, said on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law when he made a Christmas quiz in Downing Street during the last December lockdown, although there was a ban on Christmas parties.
One of ministers of Johnson's government opposed that the quiz, in fact, had been made “virtually”, online.
However, Downing Street staff participated in it and they gathered around computers.
In Great Britain, Johnson has faced demands to resign from his Prime minister post.
Last December, when there was a strict lockdown in London and there was a ban on Christmas parties, despite the lockdown, Johnson's ministers made various parties.
The British people and media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, an editor for commercial television ITV in Britain: This day two years ago, Boris Johnson overhelmingly won the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party says that he should resign.
It's notable how quickly things have changed.
Do you want to change your mind and save your life?
In spring, new elections will be held in Hungary, which could discontinue Victor Orban's 12-year rule.
Those elections will be important for the whole EU.
How much can we expect that they will be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will not be probably democratic as well, as last two Orban's elections were not democratic, too.
His party Fidesz controls media, change electoral district borders so that he could benefit from that, and they make other more or less cheats.
The last one has been that everyone can vote from anywhere.
That enables Fidesz drive voters from districts where results are certain to those ones where results are uncertain and where they might be defeated by their opponents.
So I just repeat that the elections will not be fair at all.
Do you think that it will be as unfair as between years 2014 and 2018?
The situation has completely changed.
Before, it was not going on that Fidesz would win elections, but with what results they would win and if they would have a constitutional majority.
Now, there is a real chance that the united opposition will receive more votes and mandates.
That's very unusual for Victor Orban and his party.
Will they be even tougher trying to keep power?
Yes, we can see some signs that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
A short time ago, independent media published a record of the parliament chairman and Lászlóa Kövéra, one of Fidesz' leaders, in which he was telling the secret intelligence service directors that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of that news.
Everything starts with a language.
I was spanked quite often, last time when I was 14, Mom isn't particularly patient, neither am I, Dad is very patient, but suddenly he flares up extremely (just because of me).
I'm also very choleric and I was enraged as a small child, to the extent that I lied on the floor and turned blue, I was even given a shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes, they just gave me a smack, and sometimes, they spanked me because they didn't know what else they should do.
Definitely, I also tend to solve things the same way, I quite scuffled as a child, now as an adult and when I'm angry, I just hit something to calm down, when I was a child, I hit my parents' hands or so (in order not to get beat up), so nothing extreme, but I always feel like doing similar things.
I can't say what role my quick temper plays, but for sure, my parents' upbringing has also influenced that.
I'm afraid of losing my temper with my children and spanking them, too.
I think that spanking children is bad and that parents shouldn't do that, especially if they are frustrated and don't know what else they should do, on the other hand, probably all parents might botch up something at least once in their lives, they are sometimes a bit tough with their children, so I don't even blame them of that.
It doesn't offend me anyhow, I don't see why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and definite.
I would call mother-fuckers those who make laws of such poor quality.
And I'd like to know if you're afraid of losing your job and getting no salary?
Can one really suppose that people want and buy the product and you'll be able to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's hideous world.
Where will Slovak get by the trial with the journalist Kuciak's murderers?
Proceedings against four men accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová have started in Slovak.
The deaths of the investigative journalist and his girlfriend have changed Slovak.
They have stirred up the society, but they have also revealed the machinations of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his contacts with the most influent Slovak politicians and judiciary.
Will the proceedings turn Slovak significantly?
This is mainly journalists' fault.
How is it possible that they wrote about that petition much more than the anti-petition of all medical faculties deans which was issued one or two days later?
Of course, they put up with that and the society paid for that.
On ČT, people still died of covid half a year ago.
Another government close to end and there is still no law on involvement of municipalities in repository selection
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be revised completely.
Andrej Babiš' governement is close to an end and the law which should ensure respect for municipality interests and their citizens when selecting and allowing deep repositories for highly radioactive waste has not still been approved.
Legislative Council of the Government stopped the proposal discussion, which was submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its contents is in contradiction not only with those municipalities united in Platforma against deep repositories, but also with Svaz měst a obcí ČR.
Local governments expect that the law will strengthen their powers regarding the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the government started to prepare it and which is also require by the Czech nuclear law and a European regulation.
We expect that the new government, based on their agreement on coalition, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal, which Platforma has had, is criticised for mainly: the proposed extent of how much municipalities and public can influence selection of the repository location is insufficient and cannot make respect for municipality and their citizens interests.
It can be only effective if municipalities or public will be able to influence if the process will continue or not in the area.
That can be ensured by imposing an obligation to the Repository Management to ask for the municipality approval before any procedure will start.
The submitted proposal of the subject intention almost omits the possibility of the public influence and make citizens just statistic figures during authorisation procedures.
There is also no provision concerning compensations for municipalities in the proposal in the whole procedure of search and selection of the repository location, its authorisation and operation.
Nowadays, municipality representatives do not have many legal possibilities how they could protect their citizens' interests when searching the repository location.
They can comment or appeal only in some authorisation procedures, however, it is the authority or minister who decides about the issue of the permit.
Any legal action has no suspensive effect on the performance of exploration or construction works.
The participation in the decision-making of local governments required by Platforma is a common principle used in many democratic countries and definitely in those where the authorisation of the repository has been developed, e.g. in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which outsources legal offices to prepare legislative matters.
In this case, it is the agreement, and related agreements, with legal office HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. which SÚRAO concluded with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for the works is, acording to the agreement registry, almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-mayor of Cejle in Hrádek and Platforma's spokesman against deep repositories said: We are waiting for a change for the better made by the new government after ministers of industry, who only postponed the improvement of local governments position against state bodies when searching deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors.
We are offering a helping hand.
We also thank Svaz měst a obcí for their support, which also considers the problem with insufficient powers of municipalities the same way as we do, and also the villages concerned in those localities.
Platforma against deep repository includes 51 members (35 villages and towns and 16 organisations) who make effort to change the state's attitudes to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste management, which will not be only applied to deep repositories.
Platforma also wants that decisions on selection of repository locations must be first approved by villages concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced by fear to lose weight: he lost 90 kilos.
Although he has not had to change his lifestyle for many years, he was finally frightened by physicians.
They told him that he would die unless he lose weight.
And that worked.
Goodman lost 90 kilos step by step, which is half of his previous weight 180 kilos, The Sun reports.
He showed his new figure proudly in Los Angeles at first night of animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty one from sitcom Roseanne has become a new person!
John liked to make jokes that his family and friends asked him to lose weight because his huge body caused furniture cracking.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in 2018 during an interview with AARP.
This time, I wanted to do that slowly.
To move, to do exercises.
Now I am at the age when I cannot afford just sitting, Goodman said to ABC, his transformation is amazing.
It's also important what kind of word “boss” and in what you want to use it.
If it's just a text on platform that has readers from the field of gambling I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it's, let's say, a formal text and for university readers, I would search how to describe the word boss.
Moreover, there are more kinds of bosses.
E.G. there are several bosses in game called Dark Souls etc., right, so a “boss” is someone like a lord / rule of a certain level, and then there's a top boss...
There are hidden bosses in many games (super boss, hidden boss), who you don't even have to defeat so that the game or a level would be over, but they're usually even more powerful than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, in which there are bosses, but a player doesn't fight with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so can we call them like bosses at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
So the word boss has different meanings, it's not so difficult in Czech language or other languages (Catalan is interesting, the word boss is sometimes translated as a final opponent).
It's just important for a story or a game, it's controlled by a computer, the opponent is much stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
Missing Petra from London searched by whole world.
Also the Czech police participates.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3rd.
Also the Czech police have participated.
They have been searching the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7th.
They help the British police via Interpol.
Czech woman Petra Srncová was last seen by her co-workers on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
The so-called yellow memo was issued by Interpol because of her.
So the missing Czech woman is being searched by the whole world.
“The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police,” Kateřina Rendlová, the police spokeswoman, confirmed.
“We share the information related to the case,” she added.
The search for Petra has appeared on the police website.
She is said to be of 168 cm height, she is slim and she has got brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She probably comes from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and co-workers worry about her, as her disappearance is not very typical of her.
Also local deputy Harriet Harman has participated in the search for Petra.
She has helped with the distribution of leaflets showing Petra's face.
„We worry about her very much,“ she said at Saturday's press conference.
In connection to Petra's missing, the British police have arrested a suspect.
However, it is not clear what the identity of the man is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorised by Agent Tesla
While there was a slight decrease of targeted attacks in October, there was, on the contrary, a great increase of them last month as the year is close to an end.
We noticed a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks have been targeted to the Czech Republic.
The hackers strategy has been still the same.
An infected attachment of an e-mail should attract the user by its name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While the dangerous attachment contained word “invoice” in its name last month, this time it was Copy of invoice corrections in 11,2021...exe,” Martin Jirkal from Eset says.
Spyware contains functions which scan Internet browsers and other programmes, e.g. e-mail clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malware code actively search saved logins, which are subsequently sent to hackers.
The last strong campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the turn of August/September, and there has been an increase of hackers attack as the year is close to an end.
Also spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, hackers do not aim at the Czech Republic in particular in this case and security experts noticed rather global campaigns in November.
Compared to October, Formbook became slightly weaker in November, however, it has still been the main cause of almost one fifth of all detections.
There were attacks within the whole month on a regular basis, especially on October the 3rd, 10th and 15th.
Formbook contained in most cases an attachment with .exe suffix, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
There still appears “receipt” in the name.
A Czech attachment can be far more dangerous to a Czech user.
Security experts have monitored a significant decrease and lower activity in programme Fareit, which made up 1,6 % of attacks and it has not had any big attack campaign in the Czech Republic over the past month.
The nowadays democracy of clever fellows who don't need oxygen, as oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The Prague procession was even bigger than reported by media.
According to taken shots as the procession was going along the riverbank and according to my experience as a protester, I'd say there were even 10,000 people.
The people in the procession overcrowded the riverbank and the bridge and also the opposite riverbank road.
That means, there are lots of people, indeed.
And much more passers-by are spontaneously joining the procession made of about 4,000 protesters.
I say that something new has been born here, Radek Mokrý writes.
That's because a few big groups of people or classes haven't been satisfied for a long time, which has made them cooperate closely.
Just anti-vaxxers, face mask opponents etc. wouldn't be able to make and pay such a big procession.
The campaigns of the organisation Chcípl pes have been more and more popular with people, they remind me of Milión chvilek for anti-democracy.
It's sometimes my feeling that they rent the same stage and technical equipment.
It's hard to say what organisation could be made up from that dissatisfaction, not only funding is important, but also whether there will be four or more vaccine doses by Pfizer instead of three ones.
Definitely, the movement will be neither left-wing or central, you can bet.
For sure, there will be more than three doses of vaccine needed, as it's obvious that we will have to be vaccinated every half a year.
I'm happy that vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant step made by researches human beings can be rightly proud of.
End of deadlock, new Bulgarian Prime Minister proclaims change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev appointed Kiril Petkov from an anti-corruption movement We keep on changing, which won the November election, to form the new government.
He has managed to formulate the new government of broad coalition which is to take office in a few days.
There has been a political crisis in the country since April when the former government lost the election after many anti-corruption protests.
However, winning parties proclaiming anti-corruption fight and power abuse had not been able to make an agreement about anything, so there took place two other early elections.
What cats do when nobody watches them?
“Secretly” taken videos have become a global smash hit.
At the weekend, people in Britain have concerned more and more about a 32-year-old Czech woman who had been searched by London police for a few days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was on her way home in the south of the British capital city.
Any information about the children nurse is beside the police requested also by her employee or female deputy for the part of London where she lived.
“Petra's missing is unlike her behaviour and we've worried about her very much,” Lucy O'Connor from the police department in district Lambeth, where Srncová worked, said in her Saturday video spot.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also much worried about her and they just want to know where she is” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her work on Sunday 28 November at about 7:45 PM and went home in district Camberwell.
She was reported to be last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her missing was announced by one of her co-workers on 3rd December.
According to British media, Srncová worked as “nursing assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We worry so much about our dear co-worker Petra who has been missing,” the hospital facilities group shared on twitter.
“We would like to ask anyone who has any information that could help find her to call the police,” they said.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumperk (and also the regional councilwoman from Piráti Party), has been reported by an anonymous of copyright infringement made by her paintings.
However, the court decided that she does not break the law by her paintings of Krteček.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road, which meant a culvert without a lid.
It was a matter of life and death.
The town municipality forwarded the complaint to the ŘSD, which is the road owner, and as they did not react, the hole was still there.
Finally, both authorities had a discussion about their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD started to “solve the situation intensively”.
The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the match with Vegas, he alternated and from this time on the ice rinks of the NHL has not yet presented himself.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver-based fullback announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning us time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of his shots.
The Plzeň hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had hip problems and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francik" caught 36 games, his success rate of interventions is at number 92.3 %.
Charles puts on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas card chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille at the races helps to put on a veil.
On its website, this was reported by the British news station BBC.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and the foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races at Ascot.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil in color matched with a bright dress.
Slavia by efotbal.cz she promised Berber a million for the title, the hard man denied it.
Prague-criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former deputy chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman berbr was supposed to have promised Slavia Prague one million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
It was reported by the server efotbal.cz with the fact that he got to a part of the police files.
Jaroslav tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the vršovický club, said that the red and whites had not committed any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan nezamar, who last summer in the Championship club finished.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red-whites was in frequent contact with both berb and the former sports director of the then second-league Vysehrad Roman rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The criminalists allegedly worked with information that Slavia berbrov promised a financial reward for this when she received the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors slavie Tvrdik.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, did not seek to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard, " Tvrdík said for the news list.
Among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some former players of dark-skinned Slavia and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
In mid-October last year, the case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police crackdown on several places, including the FAČR Prague headquarters.
The highest ranking in the affair is berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPS are LARPing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen have to take out of the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars-Toyotas hi-lux-are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles-at a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga v3s even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones-few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
Air defense: medium-cold war, obsolete; short-range-good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I got a chase right outside of town.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat down and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox came in a minute.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, he was waving his headboard all over the place, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got out of my seat, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive stuff in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Homeland got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The irozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka kabrhelová speaks with Dominika kubištová, editor of the irozhlas server.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the numbers that the older generations have suffered), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that could be seized by trained people, we do not actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where who can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced need to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will be conducted only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
especially we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are such situations that you watch a dude who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, go on the attack alone among 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they'll take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill" get a defender " is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect any major reversal for the coming weeks.
The onslaught in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As it was said, the first to get to the domestic patients is Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the west, they tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the westernmost position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from the museum's maple, the rest are in a state of disrepair.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was absent a little, he went regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He went to school in the countryside, did various monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the ad (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I sold often to gypsies, they always had money, they did not try any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later and said he had already overwritten it..
I myself say that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves the way he belongs in a decent society (works, works, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, he reaches out, eviscerates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble.. well, I don't care what color it is, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash on Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemia ambulance service, told pravu.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of bavorov and, for reasons not yet established, he turned into the opposite direction.
Štěpánka schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident after the collision with the ŠKODA Octavia.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute prehospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in české Budějovice, said paramedic fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš neuheisl also orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and send the post office data for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officers expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the time of sale, it will be charged by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for transportation.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to the Czech post, the problem is that people do not respond to requests to supply the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Matyáš vitik, a spokesman for the Czech post.
Dealing with inflation
See headline, How would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get maybe added (who is the employee)?
They added 2% gross to me this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven rapists are sent to prison for only six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from kostomlat, on which an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her.
He took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency number and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made up everything so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Czech police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the PCR.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally am of the opinion that the Slavs have long been ethnically and culturally we are not, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which God or gods should man choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will severely punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it is said that there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed would send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, x months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All branches of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of defense.
We can say this: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or, for example, a Mongolian Raider.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well, bless you.
Just one U.S. election that screws up their budget, and NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the poles have already shown once that they just need to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantor of independence for a long time is a heavily armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today can pilot a remote-controlled means of any teenager, so what would it not work.
We don't need a border wall, that sucks today, but a pimply teenager behind a remote control device can handle it.
How not to drown in a boxed tsunami
You unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is swamped with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by Agreement, bring to the involved store (project map KAMsNIM.cz there are almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid cluttered blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One of such stores is also Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to us by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
Application www.KAMsNIM.cz however, it shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, swaps and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukličme česko association.
Rather, it seems wrong to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throws everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend-it starts in January-and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans-at work, on the streets-and mentioned so many events that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, split between the right and the left, agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe", and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticise Macron for being pro-European and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened Cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the first rungs of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu / being stung" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't really feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to spend it on living together.
Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even slightly their route, is adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
With the sale of tickets began carriers already during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also cover Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be Interjet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be launched by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem-mělník-Nymburk-Kolín.
The carrier will replace české dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of transport.
RegioJet will run a total of 16 routes daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův brod, ž .ár nad sázavou and Kolín stations.
LEO Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar running times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva Trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in, for example, Českolipsko, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav through česká lípa to rumburk, Trilex trains of the German company die länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, die.
I've never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in the schools that black people were often sold into slavery by black people themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern one.
I have not met with the fact that someone deliberately concealed the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in one's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some of their good successes, and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people nowadays idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the south was a slave owner, and a lot of things went against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was terrible at some universities, the students were radicalized enough, and the schools encouraged them to do so many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the idea that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At the moment, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also did not encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole useless from the point of view of any personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is such a nice guy, he preaches more theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coronavirus shit that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite church.
Officially Moderna are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on botanická street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took him from Austria
Breclav-the flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the reintal – Breclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we take part in every year with the section, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me that I was chosen, Scout amálie budíková told the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the reintal – Breclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually scouts go by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch cikrle.
About the subsequent delivery of light on Saturday 18. December will be taken care of by Scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear veils, try to observe the spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem light event, Zuzana hrbková.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which wanders through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its distribution for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that say subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will properly use this money, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned-a useless product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million “XY funded/co-funded by project XY” signs in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not a promotion of a company that gives work to x people, this is a hindrance to development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap-especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I find that they also influenced me - it's just so sophisticated that one can not always avoid it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who now want a total ban on programme-driven (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics-I would have banned the internet.
I have a feeling that this virus is rooted in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original point of view, which I'm going to say is critical thinking"
2. "I'm not gonna believe everything the media says."
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV fell in the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of them this year have two hundred
Los Angeles-movie theaters, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies and will premiere a record-breaking two hundred this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDB.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years is scoring among the audience and significantly increasing the ratings, therefore these pictures are being created more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those pictures that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be a lot more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, there are also popular pictures at home alone, love in heaven or the classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, recalled the BBC server.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas (countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers for Christmas already 22. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
The rival station lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll be home for Christmas movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its films, which, although uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not enter the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Thus, the Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he had to attack the better position out of 20. the rung you ran in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable, however, will not interfere in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in the end.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher, Max Verstappen of the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title, will go to the track from the last rung.
Mazepin, according to the statements of the Haas stable, is quite well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine, because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved, " said her representatives for formula1.com.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
A possible substitute would have to pass a qualification or drive in another part of the weekend.
With covid-19 does not meet the first racer.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the season, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for that, too.
And nobody cares what the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 spread of a contagious human disease
(1) anyone who intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of the case.
(2) by imprisonment for two years to eight years, the offender will be punished,

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home they never wore sweaters very much," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.

In the United States, new cases of police violence are coming to light, this time during the crackdown on nationwide protests.
The demonstrations, which broke out after African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest, opened a debate about systematic racism, the work of the police and cases of brutality against American minorities.

The union is pouring money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having that money.
I really don't see how the fact that the union stops giving us money will cause us to use that money for something else...
You could argue that the money from the subsidies could be used better, but that's a whole other discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Sappers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.

Health and Human Services is looking into another case of a child from Adam's.
"Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from adamovo, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov elementary school is not proven,“ said ciupek.
There were six cases in the county in a week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the national reference laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the state Institute of health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from the same department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and adamovo.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was abroad.

California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a ruling Friday by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld Texas ' ban on abortion, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that set the right to abortion across the U.S. at roughly 24. months of pregnancy.
However, the court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban in this case was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand damages of at least $ 10,000 (over $ 220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, components for "Ghost weapons" or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of Supreme Court liberal Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from judicial review to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like, and also there is an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that yet.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should come on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficiency.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against the law if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw € 36 billion from the EU fund to rebuild the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in view of the fact that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure jeopardize its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building"impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under Democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to understand it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I also met one yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an eviction, I will not even smell in any market, no action, golden shop on the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of touch than most vaccine supporters.
Although rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are being brought into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of robust analyzes.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states no one solves.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never because of grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to bed, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "catch" the stove only brought and put so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to obey, I received a couple of blows to the ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and measure) is beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether to disobey and get it or get better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System defense
In 1999, when Vojtěch CEPL, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, was answering a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning since childhood in school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch CEPL voted the question.
Recently, however, among lawyers, the opinion that the constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is increasingly emerging.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch CEPL belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But CEPL was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution, among other things, is a kind of order of government, consisting of individual rules that set out the politicians of the game.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for the life of a multi-month baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the clinic of pediatric anesthesiology and resuscitation at the faculty hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told the newspaper.
The course is much simpler, easier, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period, " Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were on the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid-19 pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults both adolescents and several-month-old babies.
In hospitals, even children in severe condition due to coronavirus are found.
"At the moment we have a child of several months and adolescent age," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital FN Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, there were 6. December to the death of six children aged 0 to 14 years.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department-he is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, so in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They are visible on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much outside the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music plays in my head, Josef kurfírt laughs.
He was nursed by the Liberec opera and originally played the horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only in the F. šalda theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef kajetán tyl theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the film philharmonic orchestra or the podkrkonoše symphony orchestra.
China gives the impression that the disease has been contained and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist jirouš: China gives the impression of having managed the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was facing criticism for failing to stop an outbreak that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavirus, for example, even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do not you want an elephant?
I got him, and he's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, the car washes the trunk, the children play with it.
Oh, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
All right, high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there's giant shit everywhere, the car is broken, the kids are fighting, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says, " you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."..
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different, and it will be successful.
I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and tangerines' it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, I'm just saying: D
Be that as it may, This is a senseless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Kosman Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from breeding animals for Life, reported The Sun newspaper.
Monkey rehabilitation specialists who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff of Monkey World in Dorset and now she is again happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent magistrates ' court, she was given a 12-week suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The head of the small monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.“
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanely.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, " Do you want cocaine?“
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the calculation of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts you learn from that prehistory three times in a row, when you bravely skip the whole 20. century?
Like you're going to carry the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor to the exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
Just write a 1 test and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and ask random people if they can figure out the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the vast majority won't even take a bite and tell you they don't give a shit.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's kind of a learning curve for a lot of people who are going to need this thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand at the machine, I meant it... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
However, the price of barbarians standing in front of these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, covid here probably never reached this size.
Wedding at first sight: the war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can not leave Switzerland right away, " Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Things between Kadri and Andrea have been rocky since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he was upset with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife did not like even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on things like that, and even in my family, we never really said those things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
After that, he did not think of anything better than to climb to 5. floor and open the window to climb into the apartment.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained cchaa.
The man confessed that on the incriminated day he drank some alcohol.
And since he needed money, in his drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to 5. the floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and is tied in effect to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that enough of a reason?

Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities came over 60 percent of voters
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of komňa na uherskohradištsku, lužice na mostecku, Nová ves na liberecku and in rovná na pelhřimovsku.

The average age of newly elected deputies is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections to the chamber of deputies were held there, said Eva krumpová, deputy chairwoman of the CSO.
She recalled that because of the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding both in equipment and staffing.
In the uherskohradiště district, an association of independent candidates won Saturday's election, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The candidate Stan received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for komňa, their vote was given to them by 18.52 percent of voters.
The former mayor of the village, Jana křižková, who is a member of the privateers, also joined the council again.
On one mandate in the council achieved Komnenans – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of rovná on pelhřimovsk, the association for rovná won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the association of independent candidates 1 and one from the association of independent candidates 2 entered the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The lužice-svinčice association led by Mayor Jindřich John again won the re-election in lužice na mostecko.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second ended the candidate municipality for the people, which the vote gave 43.27 percent of voters, in the council thus will have three representatives.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová ves na liberecka were won by independent candidates naděje pro Nová ves before the ANO movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
Ano received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gained a mandate more and has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent of the electorate.
On Monday, the results of the elections will be discussed by the state election commission.
Then they will be published in the collection of laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of Science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like that 30-year-old
Tl; dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headfirst from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, which was interfered with by the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an hour after midnight Saturday emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of zzs-medical and medical-immediately went to the place.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vitkovice caught coal.
But not as it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the zzs Ms region.
I am more concerned than I am about the coronavirus because of the inadequate response of the public and the authorities

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The underdog Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a slayer.
Charles Oliveira in the light heavyweight did not hesitate, demonstrated against Dustin Poirier a great choke and defended the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt by technical KO in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'malley.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought by the women's bantamweight bout between the notorious Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and sharpened her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, penova did not force herself to make any more mistakes and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with the help of a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
Thus, the American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, although Poirier did better, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to tap the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'malley scored a masterful victory, having already put a hard right back on raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in English express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine gender, feminine gender or middle gender.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns, in which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unstressed form.
For example, the words" swivel "or" hip "are both masculine and feminine, in the first they are pronounced according to the pattern" machine", in the second according to the pattern"song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example:" row/row"," kohlrabi/kohlrabi " or "potato / potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally unstressed, but gradually they take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender unmoved, but in the masculine gender it has endings along the lines of "Castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Three months we did not see the blue sky and choked, describes a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities there and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could prime minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to shut it down.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It's become a trend for victims to finally open up about their trauma.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic flooded houses under construction, families do not have money to finish
Prices for building materials in recent weeks and months have risen by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people have gotten into a sticky situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage lending, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent, " says BHS economist Štěpán křeček.
We build two or three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them happen to us.
For us as a construction company it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contracted, even if the material has risen in price.
So we do without earnings, " said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, " added slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said hamster.
We're having a good time, and we're gonna have a better time.
But real visions are missing, says commentator ČRO-mujrozlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
Apart from the prime minister and ano President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the chamber of deputies spoke to the nation this year.
What did we learn?
I have my own topic, which I have chosen, I follow up on the Bachelor, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I will write a written part.
Stateswomen are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something is left in his head, then this commission will not unnecessarily choke him on theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State University and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which immediately came to me and I had it right.
Other than those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the course there is an exam, which reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't block e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You still have to get her to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that insta throws sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a bare minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been bugging me a lot lately, so I might have to go down to TikTok, where a lot of the artists in my line of work are very successful, and they don't give a damn about it.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Workers ' Party of Donbass
The union-yes, the break-up-no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza forest 8. December 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of 17. March 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that " the union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they" abolished " a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Bialowieza forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, inhibited agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post – Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria-all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a"vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the understanding that I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday-describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself-nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Brno on hlavas and in the underpass of the ladies handed out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigade, they can not throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's too bad the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year but then another six months passed and she started to go crazy.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down so she doesn't get any amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are rampaging around buying a cloud of tests and rushing to positive, who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is making it difficult for companies, carriers, and others to have their employees put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped this antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, war is new, and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing hazing.
I see the good old bastard's coming back.
After several years of oppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't care, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money earned came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to rustle up several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made one feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump right on every speck and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or " fat " account.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management and do not stick their nose into anything.
Regular evaluation is therefore somehow happening, in the form in which it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set yourself some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also within our company a little unique-there are departments what are more "corporate".
Sometimes one gets the feeling that we are such an almost-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so we don't bother much as long as the results are there.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched without success for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman, who went missing at the end of November.

Unfortunately, British police have this afternoon confirmed to our representative office in London that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we will not share any more information about the case.
Condolences, said on Twitter kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen 28. November on the bus on the way from work, before boarding you should still pick up money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol included her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
The police have already detained a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he had in the case and what he suspected, but did not disclose.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the chamber of deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put more demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva krumpová, 1. vice-president of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday 12. December at 03: 49 hours.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the state election commission and, after approval, will be published in the collection of laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population in all its strata, I have a problem with this until now.
On vaccinations (tomorrow!) I'm most excited because thanks to him, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not jerks.
He would be deprived of the office of President and the capacity to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are, as others here have mentioned, very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure shredding a file could even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: the number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based People, reports the website of the daily dailymail.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women aged between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year is higher than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for family studies (ifs) showed.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who report not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said ifs researcher Lyman Stone.
Among people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, for 2021, only 5% of them said that they had been without sex for the past year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among the "less religious", the trend has risen from 10 to 20%, " stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of covid-19 is whether society should force a part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question, on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
I. E.for example, the question of whether if we do not order them and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated, and he ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the CPC, is saying something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski area operators can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country skiing jizera fifty.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about the Lord's prayer.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we went down one of these rather wide streets, and we don't see anyone in the middle-the followers of the hare krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul, " she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly show that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy group, which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to dpa, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her license for not giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test, and after they found she had more than two pints in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does his best.
But Juraj šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked in American stories about dog lovers.
But in doing so, they forgot the essential thing: the regularities of the film craft.
After the cheesy film by F. brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another film is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film here I watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog handlers, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julia, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and if the correct "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined-on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the she is taken to the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what content pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A couple of shoplifters from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen coming to the den in search of "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guest house will, of course, get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slacking as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
In addition, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters of the characters and the point and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddy.
However much Lukáš vaculík, Jitka ježková or Nela boudová try to settle their party, they do not have much to play for.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the bohemian nature of the cameraman Vladimir holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long membership in the club of dachshund breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur-conceived stunt would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant abuse from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how much shit you understand, but that's only because you've never tried.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have noted at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israeli water authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are more tank cars.
Water lines and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, staying in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and world powers " understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I gave the lady a little more doubts and questions, and finally thanked and left.
You can call me a scumbag, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers on the weekend went to the mountains, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves at the lifts covid certificate.
While skiers do not complain about customers ' lack of interest, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanuš praised the interest.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend skiing in the new season also in jeseníky.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in branná in šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfekt, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after having contracted covid-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René hroneš from the Skicentre špindlerův mlýn told CTK.
"We recorded only units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra bokišová from the Opava shop skiopava.
A greater onslaught is expected in the period of ski courses.
David šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that covid-19 is not as interested in renting ski equipment as it used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, rental in the novako na Bozi Dar area is in great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the complex pavlína nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here, like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Abroad, smart and clever people leave, who have no property here.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
With the rest, however, absolutely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orbán won, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the elections at all.
If it's a bad place to live, some traditional v4 freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can not be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand The Crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social networks posted a bloody photo of his face.
Is this a real wound, or is this a trial for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
The public is also being urged to cooperate by Harriet Harman MP, who on Saturday drew attention to Srnc's case at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC News website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (IE CA 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but CA 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out on so many points that I do not even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the" concentration " at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague from Sunday new timetables apply, mainly suburban connections will be affected
Passengers in the Prague integrated transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which relate mainly to suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, Express trains from české Budějovice stop at the station zahradní Město.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to český brod.
The R17 express train from české Budějovice and benešov will stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
PID will spread to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to světlá nad sázavou, blatna u Jesenice, staré splavy and turnov.
Buses to Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
With the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague zličín, which will go as far as žatka.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and kralovice u rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will start.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from the metro station střížkov, not from the station nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes through mělník, dubou and česká lípa to nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through mělník and dubou to doks, mimona and jablonné in podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on ten local Central Bohemian lines, including to mochov, dobříš and rožmitál pod třemšín, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02: 30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long – term restrictions continue on the lines Prague-Beroun, Prague-lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from dobříše with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use pid tickets up to milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and hořovicka in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and dietetic.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy a maximum of pizza buns and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so, unfortunately, it is.
And it's not about trees, which you must necessarily see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from off-piste skiing, but it's one of them.
Confessions of Dara about the relationship with the bear: I did not look forward to this at all
Czech showbiz pond from Friday does not live by anything other than revealing the relationship of Dara rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been dating since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a lengthy message explaining why she hid her love from them for a long six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, Sorry, Not a bear," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he was the one who hit on her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both did not look forward to, but we knew that it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it pops out of the can, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
There, in turn, Nedvěd serves for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the finalization of Nedved's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us this, thank you.
We, too, are only human, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.for better or for worse, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems to me like the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like vranovská, francúrská, etc., this is a pretty bad address), even some parts of židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the District of Veveří is very student, královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it is close to most of the faculties of but (I do not know where exactly you start).
I have never rented, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still have some information missing :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket or they go by the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against having a statue in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging / digitizing that (even longtime professionals) either somehow throw it by eye, or write something in the manner of XXX *** or ... (by convention) and make a note that it is illegible.
The truth is, it's pretty legible in this case, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: isn't it more of a Odryská empire (kingdom) than odrynská?
PSS: someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is a smile.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing high-standard relationships.
Besides, it's quite interesting with English, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on cejl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have to :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, then I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix slováček (78) without Dada and mistress gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle at the advent wreath, Felix slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I have seen the lady's wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to blesko, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house on the vineyards, where Dada after his departure was left alone.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
But we kept talking, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says slováček, who was happy to meet Lu .ko Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other force that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
The police are few and can not afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level is not.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape does not have to be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, less rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage our land also amplifies the impact.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it will be so, I can barely keep in skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and this tactic (what I tried in the Franchise Hockey manager) is also a total fool.
And whether you're a hockey team" Medvedev Russia "or" Lama China " so to lose by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who prick, what the judges notice do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it is probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And IMHO if it were the other way around, it is as always another time, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: the number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
Saturday 11. the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections in December.
5766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since 13. October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, this is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing the "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British health security authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died on Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is growing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's post.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes constituency boundaries to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is so that everyone can in practice vote where he wants.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the constituencies decided to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not if Fidesz would win, but how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will not in an effort to keep the power play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, in which he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, parents mom does not have much patience, I do not either, dad has it for a long time, but then it blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a little terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they no longer knew.
I have a tendency to deal with things by force, I used to fight quite a bit when I was little, now I hit something for discharge, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the arm (so I don't get too much in the face), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't tell the extent of my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer" educational, " but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks up something, it is probably impossible not to at least slightly prznit their children, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the op should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws in this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a power outage?
Can you really count on the fact that people want the product and buy it, and you will have something to pay the mortgage on?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is all the fault of the press.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counterpetition of the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, let the fool and the company, it hopped off.
On Czech television, they were dying of covid six months ago.
The next government ends, and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of prime minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government interrupted the consideration of the draft submitted to the government by the Ministry of industry and trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities united in the platform against deep-sea storage, but also with the union of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options in deciding on the repository, which is promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from the minister Karel Havlíček, which the platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities in particular: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the choice of a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the management of storage sites to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a project almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities, realistically, according to today's legal norms, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their observations or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploration or construction work.
The Codecision of Municipalities called for by the platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s. r. o., concluded by the SÚRAO and following on from the contract with lawyer Jan zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is expected to be almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from hrádek and spokesman for the platform against deep-sea disposal, said: after the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments in the search for deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the union of cities and municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a major construction project in the same way as the directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep underground storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep underground storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: he lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body made furniture crack.
"I shoved everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can no longer afford to sit still, said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If this is some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was a formal text or a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain boss.
To all this, there are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc.has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the Lord / Ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to defeat in order for the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like half-life, where bosses are, but the player does not directly deal with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
Well, then there are the mini-bosses.
It is a simple monosyllable to somehow translate boss just can not, Czech and other languages it somehow does not solve (interesting is only Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent).
It is, in short, for a story or game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra srncová since 3. December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She's been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since 7. December.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28. November.
British police have been looking for her since 3: 00. December.
Because of her, Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina rendlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, a Labour MP, was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by a Tesla agent.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
A large campaign in connection with the Tesla agent we have seen 18. November.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is supposed to arouse the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the 11,2021 receipt corrections...exe, " said Martin jirkal of ESET.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the invaders is growing again.
In November, spyware formbook also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November intercepted rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
Attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3 days., 10. and 15. November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an extension .exe, which bore the name request for specification.
However, the name účenka also continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity is registered by security analysts with the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
The demos of today's smart guys who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Judging by the footage of the parade along the embankment and from my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of about 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment communication.
That is means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only the antivaxers themselves, the antirouškáři and co. they couldn't fill or pay for a parade this big.
The actions of the Dead Dog Association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is difficult to say what movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-and multi-dose one.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or a centre-right movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, since it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, to which humanity is rightfully proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has instructed the formation of a new government Kirill Petkov from the anti-corruption movement we continue to change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, fears grew over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, for whom the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra srncová was last seen two weeks ago on her way home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived also calls for information about the worker of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeněk dvořáková kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in šumperk (and also a regional pirate councilor), was given an anonymous notice that he was infringing copyright with his paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of krteček in šumperské pokočíky do not violate the law.
In the mouth above the Elbe, the moon saw a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a hatch.
It was a matter of life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it allegedly did not respond, the hole went green.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "deal with the situation intensively".
The big comeback of the Czech smoker is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult time of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 30-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the AC and could soon reach the goal as well.
Former goalkeeper Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas, he has changed and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when an experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out of approximately three to four weeks with lower-body injuries," said the Denver unit at the beginning of October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, the American time was called out of the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had hip problems and did not catch a single match in the short pandemic year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, its success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a veil on Camille on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as a Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo on which Camille will take her on the races to help put on a veil.
The British news station BBC reported on this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, it is not even clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile in her country house in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a Christmas card image.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who has a top hat and a veil on his head, helps Camille put on her veil color-coordinated with the bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for her title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with Roman Berbr, the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, to have been promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018 / 19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got to a part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that no corrupt behavior was possible.
The server published a transcript of the police wiretapping in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for gaining the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha officials should have a million bribe to win in the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal negotiations, we have never sought to affect referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context, "Tvrdík said for the Zpravy list.
Nezmar will insult some former dark-skinned Slavia players in wiretapping, among other things, and he will also avenge his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through arbitral tribunals was sparked last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like Vyšehrad's former sports director, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but in principle of a worse type (gunners must take cartridges from the armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it was possible to get rid of Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Planes: Combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
PVO: Central - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
They were climbing nutrients from the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped to leave before anything came to light, but, of course, in a while a fox went.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost laughed, he was head-on to all sides, so I called to him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of my seat there was a mess.
I.e. even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, that would have to be a interplay of many coincidences to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal image that almost everyone has today.
So to a visible place, put expensive things at your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be cool.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Respirators found themselves significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy an auction?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stores of technology that could take up trained, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose weight over time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists / territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can lead, and it is also a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in the conflict of such scale and intensity, where guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have the right geography for that.
Above all, we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act as if they had it.
Then this comes to pass such a situation that you watch a guy who didn't hit an empty net 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they vote for him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick" skill is so terrible that I'm honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, it will last for some time in hospitals, and, as we know, a new unknown has added to the pandemic equation: A omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the Covid equation this week: The possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and it is possible to treat them at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports the success rate of 85 percent so far.
However, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools suitable for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic also highlighted the question of how the local administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will first reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape, even because the drug began to developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how the beaks grew up to us".
See you do a research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without circumstances that no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist beasts.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west looks good, the east seems bad.
But they will find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both, according to surveys, have over 20%.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to study where what is happening again, all objects on the hair are the same.
Of the one, there is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want nuclear warheads to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either for reasons of safety or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads and rockets, as they say, were kept.
If it was necessary to put on this weapon, a special unit was arrived to pick up this head and mount it on some carrier device.
In addition, museum maples, are the rest in a desolate condition.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate Gypsies, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often walked with him and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he went cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, other classes, entered the same year.
Shortly after that, there were often police dealing with something there, they threatened and threatened other students...
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called in a month that he had already transferred it to himself...
I myself say I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other as long as they act as they are in a decent society (works, works, women don't, just don't take normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he reaches out his hand, clears the apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start business, work with us, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care for as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will also respect their traditions and culture.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who carried the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for so far unknown reasons drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After a collision with Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle finished on the roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not supply data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, newly he must add VAT and hand over the post office data for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officers are expecting the package to come.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT on sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkbox, put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they added me 2% in gross, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business they run at work.
Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and overall.
And not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob logically helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant for arrest was issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went wrong.
At first, he approached the passerby and made up for a story that he was robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the officers on how to submit a notification to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore resolved by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we have not been ethnically or culturally Slavic for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with my meme, a shame that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the US: ')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence only because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree to Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world if I don't drink, something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods do you have to choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who punishes you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the tenth place, it is stated that there is no other god other than the one of Jesus.
So in such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing wrong of the thousands of gods, and the one real god that I just didn't punish will send me to hell or to a similar place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry has been constantly floundered, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or, for example, a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
He will come to me funny as you consider NATO to be something stone-cropped, we have allies, and they will therefore defend us if there is a pruser.
Well please, man.
Just one election in the US is enough to screw their budget and the whole NATO goes to a pick.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they are enough to show their backs and will take what they want.
The only thing that has long been working as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, as it would not have been.
We don't need border fortifications, that's for the first time today, but hit a teenager behind a stick of a remote-controlled device.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That is why it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
After agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging that is currently in short supply on the market and also money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% recently.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling material will be brought to Popůvek u Brňské by individuals who accumulate at home, we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything in the packaging of shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It is used as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take away sorted household waste, where to hand over expired drugs, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Rather, I feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but it does not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (especially in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency before the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be managed in half a year.
However, French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the breakup between the right and the left agree on a male, but in Europe, yes.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately commentated with criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right French presidential candidate, Éric Zemmour, is currently driving around France with the benefits that the Vichy regime, which he collaborated with Hitler in World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with it in the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they have no enlightened cantor, they will no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held first place on the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy / fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was about like "having a flu / being a purple-cropped" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to common flu, it was worse.
I have no diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

And that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a rather less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it go for a common life.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains according to the new timetable are starting to run on the railway.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even their route slightly, will be adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the dormitories.
Carriers started selling tickets already during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plans to run on average 6,783 passenger transport connections per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be Interjet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 route Ústí nad Labem - Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will travel a total of 16 connections on the track every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes apply to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, despite planned exclusive works, the carrier tried to keep its long-distance trains as running as similar as possible.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
For example, passengers await changes in the Czech Republic, where the trains of the German company Die Landermann will run on the track from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere, we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
In my life, I have not heard classes from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you at school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they were murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone intentionally hiding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already with those southern states, yes, the confederation flag and famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also have some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in South Africa was slavers and a lot of things were also against them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they will leave someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that it was terrible at some universities, those students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them as many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since reached what it had and it is no longer the same, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact are called feminists, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in the end, I also did not come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual: D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something with people connects me with such interests, views of the world and common experience, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very good guy, the sermons are more about theology than politics, but then they always agree about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to Hussite services, because it is theologically very similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3: 00 p.m. they make mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic even this time, in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year with the section, I'm looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally went by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the parish bishop Vojtěch Cikrlel.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep an distance, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way that it was as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokesman for the Bethlehem light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light traveling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame at the same time.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvětlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, but I don't understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices "xy financed / co-financed by the xy project" in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the retardation of development when this company adheres to and takes orders / employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its termination
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born Internet time is also caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think Internet ads won't move with me, but then I'm just as likely to affect me - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
That is also why I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all a candleholder, in the words of a classic one - I would disable the Internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thought"
2. "After all, I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
The TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present their viewers with a record-breaking more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been affected by audience viewers in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so these films are getting more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their name, so in reality holiday movies will be much more.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came to light in a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, then included four movies and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the agenda, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, it doesn't matter much about the story again, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that they're snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday craziness and craziness of the world we've been living in for at least two hours," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, however, successfully resolved and those kiss.
This is how it is all the time, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.

Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack on a better position from the 20th place he went in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will finally not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will go on to the track from the last place, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, while safety will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved, "her representatives said for Formula1.com.
He will not or cannot send a replacement driver to the Haas race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi " had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings in it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters have never worn much with us at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work within half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were delivered by Swarovski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
"Wool and cotton are the basis, but silk will give the sweater softness," praising the creator of his work, which, however, is not recommended to wish.
And it has one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater so far, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help the Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland officially asked NATO countries to help, in connection with the actions of the Belarus regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to their territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the ZŠ Adamov is not proven, "said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children from one of them, two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four risk free course.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, come into contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
The main hygiene manager Pavel Svrčín previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was tested.
There were also players from South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to proceed as Texas in banning abortion.
California governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion detection of heart rate embryos.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's position of the US Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in effect, although it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to apply across the US until the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged yesterday's (Friday) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said California governor.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use this power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work on measures in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister to authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers are designated and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation from at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, ghost "parts or kits for their production in California.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets, we should exactly do so," said the California governor.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June the federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state had now really renewed the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US countries in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas did not grant full immunity to court review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses has already been widely valid from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should soon be on the market.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobr, the European Commission would act in contradiction with the law if it used new powers and stopped the payment of Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure of the European Parliament to go on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a sentence on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in access to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent for Ziobr effect threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of a colony," he said.
But confess in it... With us in Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's true, in the narrow sector there were all the selected, uncommon and specialty cheeses in it, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If it's avoidable, I'm no longer going to any market anymore, I'm not going to take an action, I'm going to go gold shop on the square, maybe they don't have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't really care anymore.
I have been watching data like manure here for two years, most of the vaccination opponents are just a little more out of line than most vaccination representatives.

They punished me with a wooden spoon in their childhood.
It was never due to grades, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I would do it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next "timed" wooden spoon only brought and put it in such a way that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, it is important to me to see the part with a warning, because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether he will not listen and get it, or the punishment will be improved and the punishment will not be improved.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether the sacred document for which he swears and for which he learned at school from childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely leaning towards the first concept.
Once we have agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has become more and more and more common among lawyers.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right in one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, the constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set game rules for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
COVID doesn't choose, they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novim.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially recently, "added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-COVID syndromes were at the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
However, it is happy that no child deaths have yet been recorded in the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist is in a children's hospital - not only at the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"That's why we also recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb a fence into the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside of marked paths can't be anywhere if you don't have an exception (but of course it doesn't apply even so much outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music goes in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is satisfied with the Liberec Opera and originally played on the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically all repertoire and works as a conductor not only in the F. Šalda Theater in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for not being able to stop the infection that was turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with a trunk, the children play with him.
Well, she's just great.
If you want for 5,000, - I will sell you the elephant.
Friend: So well, Yes, it's going to be great...
After some time, they will meet and the one who has bought complains: Those who you sold it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, everywhere giant shit, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants to divorce.
What he sold says: You talk badly about an elephant, you won't sell a elephant this way...
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, this still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will lead.
It also occurred to me and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that these are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept, and it is not necessary to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing words: D
Whether it's the way it is, it's a ridiculous request
An earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-degree earthquake hit the Japanese capital of Tokyo and the surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage has been reported yet.
No tsunami warning has also been issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland tortured the monkey marmoset Milly from Britain
Horrifying footage shows the moment when the terrified monkey cowered in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it up and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother pleaded guilty to two accusations that she caused unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat and for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, her point of view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychological scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone after raiding her apartment due to drug accusations.
In the footage, it can be heard how Milly profanity profanity.
Another video shows Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to keeping cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found in her house for 1,600 pounds (roughly 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
As if you take away the same things in the breast as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffooning, when no one, with exception, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Without and on the street, you ask random people if they can manage to determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority will not even hide and tell you that they are completely in a pick.
So what the fuck is learning for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need them.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need the thing they need.
But as well, the note that you really don't need all this for standing by the machine really doesn't need it all, I thought very seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly reach the time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part in us) However, the price that barbarians will simply be high among those machines will become our own.
For example, if journalists could count, the covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately, "Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
It was creaky between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, i.e. at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He immediately dealt with Kadri's accusations of lying, gambling and debt in response to Andrea.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's supposed honesty now.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things at all and even in the family we've never really said these things very extra.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and beat the name of someone I like so much, I just can't get it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry for that when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in a confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao started his robbery trip in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he finally stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he didn't think anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
The footage from one security camera shows how he goes along the street away from the crime scene, while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank something of alcohol on a day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob him of drunkenness.
The whole thing is still in investigation.
The monkey climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and becomes effective tied to the pandemic emergency.
When it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Although the law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, new councils were elected by people in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsk, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Libereck region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.

The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Eva Krumpová, deputy chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komňní na Uherskohradišť region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.

75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimsk region, the association Pro Rovná won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 got to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
He won 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The other one was finished by the candidate Obec pro lid, which was voteed by 43.27 percent of voters, so three representatives will have in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
Independent candidates of the Nadeje pro Nové Ves for the ANO movement won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region.
59.88 percent of voters voted in favor of the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.

Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to "argue with".
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which after all was the goal for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what they do.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl; dr: Believe, for example, in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operating center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
Upon arriving at the paramedic's place, they discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man should have fell out of the window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and firefighters went to the event.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue service team, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokeswoman of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than from the coronavirus from inadequate reactions of both the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are primarily on the first line of the fight against infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
There are things to do at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a defeater.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in a lightweight bond, he put a great choke on Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a female bantamweight match between famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American entered the mutual battle as a imaginary "dwarf", because Nunesová had not lost for seven years and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the start of the duel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively, and the opponent even pushed the kick she sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced to any other mistake, and she tried to attack with a lever on her arm herself unsuccessful.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents started with a lot of excellent blows and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock off the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the card gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to match the opponent with lever to hand.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and filled him with a number of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, on the other hand, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiv in the first round.
He then charged him with a number of exactly-aimed blows and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated her next triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are masculine, feminine and central.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain uninflected.
For example, the words "rope" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the first they inflected according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the "song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example: "Rádek / rádka", "kedluben / kedluben / kodlubenna" or "/ brambor" (in the sense of food).
At the same time, both forms are literary, they have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, "okurek" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is uninflected, there are also other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "Okure" and "kopa, "donut" and "donut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained uninflected in the central gender, but has endings according to the pattern of "castle" in the masculine gender.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to venture to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future for in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I experienced how often they are treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend has happened that victims finally open up about their traumas.
But still, only a lot of people keep it for themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations is made up of" and that it is only a "trend" you help sexual rapists.
The Czechia is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to complete
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of that.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and even pay rent for it, "says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
In a year, we build two to three family houses and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult for us to abide by some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earning money, "said the owner of the construction company Zdeňěk Slivoň.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, "added Slivoň.
Copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive of the materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, construction graduates are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We're doing well and we're doing better.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by the speeches of politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
As in that, the diploma looks great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor, I always work on it all year round and then I write a written part in a week or two.
Stateswomen are completely calm with us, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I learned a week at the stateswomen and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical derivation that immediately came to me and I was right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they will teach them) and then they will just learn the project and they are sufficient.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the course in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
But don't hit everything ok with e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same pee as them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put her in such a way that she can kick Xi Jinping's ass or somehow.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you can't store stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether a lawyer, comment or save.
I'm very sorry lately, so maybe I'll have to reduce to tiktok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and can't almost commit to it.
In the end, I would also be happy if something more user-friendly came to light that doesn't drain all the creativity and energy of artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
The Union - yes, it will break - no, in the picture I express my opinion of the opponents of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Association of USR entities of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
One budget pen "canceled a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
By the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, separated fourteen republics from the world's greatest power, which were previously economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the extinction of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all as a result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first of all, the socialist camp and the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "a vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly due to the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the fact that I will put it in the fridge and make it a dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and that meat be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
These crap that when something is cheap must certainly be wrong, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth; -)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies distributed some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be a kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found who released it and finally Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good matchos, full of completely useless lessons, as I have to be wrong and not to be a PiCUS.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to cut down.
I experienced something similar with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with this person because you like him without realizing how much there is in the situation.
She threatened me several times due to the fact that I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
And also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she was terrified and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then it took another six months and she was started to fight for a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship with telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch a amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously cutting down here by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positive ones that wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we do is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under house arrest for five days in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with that cloud and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, the MLM recruiting is again returning to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you may not be interested, especially among people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money made came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, or you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump to every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in one bag.
There are people who are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't experienced many such things in a company where I work.
HR is calm, managers look after their own management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it works quite a bit for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll look at what worked out and what not) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are such a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us very much as long as there are results.
The Czech Republic is missing in Britain after its death.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that they were found dead by a woman from Uherskohradiště.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that she found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Considering the family, we will not disclose more information about the case.
Honest condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
They last saw a young woman on the bus on November 28 on her way from work, she should have collected money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing persons around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
In this context, the police arrested one man already a few days ago.
What role he should have played in the case and what she suspects him of, but she did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four municipalities were assigned new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Libereck region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for the new elections to councils in the mentioned four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03: 49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that here we have a quite dangerous contagious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its strata is, I have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be rid of the position of president and the ability to acquire it again.
However, the chance that this really occurs is very small, as the others mentioned here.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act that the president of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex for a year
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex life increased from 8 to 21 percent.
There are more than ever women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in recent years.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has risen rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they had been without sex in recent years.
It was 29% for single people. Stone added that married under 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married people under the age of 35 is still falling.
Young people divided the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's fine.
"It is true that they are a minority between singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving this trend," Stone says of these 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has risen from 20 to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who have been participating in religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious", the trend rose from 10 to 20%, "Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing this need".
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order for vaccination against covids is about whether the company should force a part of the population to behavior that they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e., for example, the question of whether if we don't recommend it to them and they die will be our fault.
My argument is that we certainly could for the death of a 80-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, is talking about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do so themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a pan-girls.
Once in the middle, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard, so we can ride on boats along the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such rather wide street and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they met with us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we also asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul, "she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
There is not much happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Matěusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is beneficial, using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group" bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor informed the chancellor of a situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record 100 attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He discussed other sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in a dispute with Belarus, and condemned Lukashenko's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunken Polish nuns blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was managed by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police told her that she could still lose a driver's license from the scene of the accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came to their sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: The laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce Gump's cheesy film - a dog that taught people to live, another film Tady we are now looking after audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady Hlídám ja from 2012.
A talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the boarding house in Šumava, who is dying, so dog handlers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika, will start inviting him to it.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also a film producer) struggled with the storytelling process already in the previous dog film, but at least children and a dog had fun there.
This time, the creators of the pair wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child and if a proper "constellation" comes true, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, despite years of training), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite her own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which a family takes her to the hospital to the heart of the miraculous healing process.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content PelMel full of implausible situations and figures were needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog competition, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving at a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits curled and pours with a cigar at the family table and demands father's whiskey and flambés as a cured vegetarian, it can't be laughed.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after the coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for characters' characters and points of view and directorial leadership.
The acting performance is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
However, Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they have nothing to play.
The only plus point of the film is the poetic footage of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshund.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long-time membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of a person with a dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse exactly from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer if he is not, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such KIDy furt, you may change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in which case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Such a complete absence of precipitation during November, as we saw at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
That's why the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
She didn't rain here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
They dry out without them and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to three last rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water has warned against drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that precipitation here may decrease depending on global warming and climate change," predicted Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israel Water Management Authority in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has the driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he informed Washington of preparations for attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians will play with them".
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I discovered that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fakes, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas started operations thanks to that.
Skiers were also not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While the staff do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are happy, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještědáakub Hanuš Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná in Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today, an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not bear the praise of the representative of the ski center in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after experiencing covid-19 disease.
On the other hand, people are ready for it and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in recent years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of Snowbear Hradec Králové company, also feels that due to covid there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were already almost halfway through.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got angry with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in a ski school is also comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich to not go abroad, it must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor of specialists.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company will not just go abroad.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started in such a way that Orbán won one beautiful day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
Another question is elections at all.
If she lives crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can also win here.
Its supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain young and educated.
Horrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood due to a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová also calls on the public to cooperate, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably settled to death," she said in Labor politician, holding a photo of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our healthcare," Harmanová said.
The police have previously arrested one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like this either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are revoking the threat of Invasion and began to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and that would correspond to the "concentration" at the borders.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables, mainly suburban connections, apply in Prague from Sunday
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) have been seeing several changes from Sunday, especially related to suburban connections.
New lines arose, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main railway station.
In the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will newly stop.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Starý Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
77 lines will be repealed, 37 new lines will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted on 12 working ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Královovice u Rakovníka was also created, replacing the canceled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will now depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, is newly canceled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02: 30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended, following from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
Changes were made to the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses to the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen region are modified.
A healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the power to exercise, I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at high speed I will buy pizza buns and a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it's the case.
And these are not trees that you must always see.
Only the tip of the trees can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they ban us from riding off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about her relationship with Nedvěd: I didn't look forward to that at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, even because of the singer, the famous football player has been able to divorce.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans in which she explains why she hid love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to her ears.
But he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who are not interested in it at all, it also makes it stand out from them from the can, or we, whose lives they hand over to each other in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match to each other, or if you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
After all, that's a joke, you want it, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there again for a long time as the vice-chairman of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now that they were waiting to conclude Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are only three weeks in paper.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us for it.
We are only people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and as he stands by me, I stand by him. Rollins concluded in good and in bad, as he stands by me.
Hi, the other commenters probably have already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very long before, so you probably won't find it very well now, but look at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlů, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and in this direction it's fine, in addition it's close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don't know where exactly you're going).
So I've never looked for a lease, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
But that's an example of a completely "normal" thinking.
Due to what several doctors somewhere decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either whether they are learning what they want and paying for it from their own or whether they are traveling according to the state and paid by the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because a few crowns will happen to a full state contribution and thanks to that, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed this about a five-day action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against anyone going to abortion is the same for you as a voice against a statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing / digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx * * * or... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it seems that you are pulling it out of a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own mark, which sits on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian kingdom (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with "
Politicians do not even know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with that English, after the withdrawal of the GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never advanced there in his life.
Yes, probably most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have it: D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go to it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček was not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light up.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist Blesk, confirming Patrasová that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where it will be at Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dade and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I know no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in the crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of people with healthy training at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is up to the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies must be changed, the landscape should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going to undergo the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture have also been recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the effects.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, that's going to be the way I barely keep my skates on the ice, the mushrooms I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who are listening to what they notice, what the referees do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite, it's just as always, and that the Czech Republic lost more often with Russia than it won, it would probably be classic "they lost" vs "MY we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, it is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on TV by Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical order for the British Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects them to increase.
So far, no one died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is rising to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial ITV for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a vast majority two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing it from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because there were not even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voter precincts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one is in such a way that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a great increase for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even more hard in order to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
She recently leaked a recording of the chairman of the parliament and one of Fidesz leaders, László Kövér, to independent media, where he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mother's parents didn't have much patience, I'm not too, the dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely extremely hard (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely now have a tendency to solve things with violence as a child I quite wanted, now I'm going to get into something at least and, as a younger parent, I have been slapping over my hand for example (so that I don't get much over my handle), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I am not able to determine the extent to which it is my explosiveness, but certainly the education has its share in it too.
I am also afraid that I will lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least a little bit of a child seams, so I don't blame them for that.
It doesn't make me feel very vague, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call kundas those that the laws create in such a quality.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can people really count on the fact that they want and buy the product and you will have something to pay for the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of four accused of murder by Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
She was mobilized by civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists can do great for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the opponents of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day ago, two later?
Whereupon, they let themselves be fooled and the company rejected it.
Czech TV was dying with ČOVID even half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is over and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government over years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from law a more significant strengthening of their options when deciding on storage, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is set by municipalities in particular: The proposed extent of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of decision-making on the selection of a location for storage, is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be really effective if municipalities or the public can affect whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted draft substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the office or minister whose interest is to issue an permission decides.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
Co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which rents external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemank.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities to state authorities in the search of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, I expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
For support, we also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage alone.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear of losing weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyles for years, doctors finally warned him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There is a completely different person from the fatty from the sitcom Roseanne!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body caused the furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in an interview for AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it were some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, formal text and, for example, university text, I would probably look for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses to everything.
For example, the game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses, that Yes, so there is "boss" something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player can't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably probably not even possible to translate boss in one word for that flat-rate, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (an interesting one is only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for the story or game, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also joined.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We will share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues fear her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her
MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czechia before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks significantly increased last month with the approaching end of the year.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice had an invoice, this time it was called Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021... exe, "said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for saved credentials that it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity increases again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still worth almost a fifth of all detection.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook most often contained the attachment of the file extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear as well.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
Security analysts for the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of the attack and in the Czech Republic have not had any major attack campaigns in recent months, record a significant decrease and decrease in activity.
Today's bunch of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and according to my experience of the demonstrators, I am not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People filled the embankment and the bridge in the procession and the opposite embankment road.
That means that people really do a lot.
A unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers themselves, anti-maskers and so on would not be able to fulfill or pay such a large procession.
The actions of the association wanted the dog are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy disturbed.
Sometimes I have such an impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or center-right movement, bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action of scientists, which humanity is really proud of.
At the end of the foot, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev instructed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement to assemble a new government from the November elections.
This has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests last year.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking at?
From the "secretly" footage taken, there is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain during the weekend about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about children's hospital employees.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also regional pirate councillors), reported that she violates copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
Magistrates referred to the complaints about the ŘSD that the road belongs to, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
The great return of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Pilsen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he alternated and since then he has not appeared on the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He made 94.5% of his saves in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL ,Francík played 36 games, his success rate of saves is 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot race in June.
Charles, who wears a cylinder on his head and a face mask, helps Camille put on her face mask in color matching her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns from Slavia in Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz reported that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice Club, said that the Red and White did not commit any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly involved in its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminologists reportedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 sk slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should be promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file does not indicate whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent's alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was unleashed last year in mid-October by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be of a new, but basically worse type (artillerymen must leave the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria climbed from the river and did damage to crops, so I was seated there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down calmly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went in a moment.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, he was gone.
That is, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a confluence of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovision, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear things put to your feet in the spacak and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of čsla, which were experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained could take, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can be led and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will no longer be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
mainly we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had him.
Then there is such a situation that you watch like a dude who did not hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and says to yourself "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "watering down a defender" is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to outplay one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: a variant of omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
That being said, Merck's molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on tape first also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "how our beak grew".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and lynching the media.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to learn again where what is, so all objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of security or speed of deployment of warheads due to a more western location.
In those underground shelters (in each maple there are two) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often too expressive, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he walked regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkeys, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same grade, a different class.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month later that he had already rewritten it on himself.
I say for myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (they work, they work, they don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, stretches out his hand, occupies apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble. so it doesn't matter what color it is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for as yet undetermined reasons drove into the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, Fajtlová said.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and hand over customs data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail informing him that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, there is also a problem that people do not respond to calls to deliver the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
This year they added 2% in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are only sent to prison for 6 months?
This just doesn't bother me how a court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reports of rape victims?
A man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers found that the woman was on a wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavs ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should man then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god than Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of thousands of gods and the one real god I didn't hit send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All the components of the Army of the Czech Republic would like something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never again invade here.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well please the lord.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what would not be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's these days, but a stubborn teenager behind the knob of a remote-controlled device can cope.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the project map KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased in price by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, high-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all the garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such sites.
"Gradually, there are more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I rather find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to use the technique from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Ahead of the weekend, Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be completed in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and the left agree on little, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being nachcípanej" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With influenza, I do not have diarrhea.
(Personal experience only. I don't think everybody has it that way)

Prose texts that follow on from the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic mindfulness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A story about a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a desired illusion.
The Bohemist and comparative artist transports the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its presentation surpasses folk versions in brutality and escalates into a horror film about emotional emptiness.
And about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we have become accustomed to listening to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about each other to make for a life together.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or even slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services under the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in Northern Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure work, the carrier also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
Carriers will also be exchanged on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they died.
I have never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't seen anyone deliberately conceal the facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
Rather, my point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and a lot of things they also resented.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them in this many times.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young it is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and it leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more he is heard.
In conclusion, I also did not see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was a two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be generally unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there's one thing that connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has sermons more about theology than about politics, but then he always gets some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. St. Michael's on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not go to Vienna for him, and in the morning they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year as well.
The Light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the club, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrl.
The subsequent distribution of the light on Saturday, December 18, will be taken care of by Scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the dormitories do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep their distance, there were as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its dissemination for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website of www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" notices in the hallways and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is a delay in development where this company is both holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads do not move me, but then I catch myself that they also influenced me - it's just so worked out that you can't always resist it.
That is one of the reasons why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling of this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be krytic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record more than two hundred of them.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, such as the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas films didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive frenzy and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years," Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, but it is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be involved in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he should have attacked for a better finish from 20th place, which he drove in qualifying.
However, Haas' Russian Nikita Mazepin will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher taking the track from the last place, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms, according to Haas.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all partie formula1.com s involved," she said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just ending season, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for that, too.
And everyone will be stolen that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
c) breaches by such an act an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him under the law, or
d) if such an act causes serious damage to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three years to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in our home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there is another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If the MZ is detached from reality, it does not matter much - it will have a defective circuit flown out and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that the departure of FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is just unlucky).
I think it would clear the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet fraternal assistance" to some of our political parties and representatives would be better clarified.
Then the people who vote for them would also have a clearer idea of whose interests they really care about.

But what would increase that funding?
The Union is pouring money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having the money.
I really don't see how the Union's cessation of giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Mutation Omikron spreads in South Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor was there contact with anyone residing abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill on his return.
California will restrict arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that kept the Texas abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established abortion rights across the U.S. until about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge him in the usual court order.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the maintaining of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He said he instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sell assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits for making them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would confirm.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that in a short time a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should come on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
Leave the amount of curriculum.
But to rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these matters, it would be really brutal to reduce.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things he will necessarily need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Don't know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's €36 billion plan to draw on the EU's recovery fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally withholding us from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "political dictates carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I will not even smell in any market, the event does not happen, the golden shop on the square, there may not be such a choice, but mostly they have everything I need and it has some order, so I am done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccine opponents are just a little more out of the picture than most vaccine proponents.
Rational discussion takes place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions get into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states is not solved by anyone.
Wow, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon as a child.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "catch" she just brought the spoon and laid it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few blows to the butt (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in a way whether he doesn't obey and gets it, or he gets better and the punishment won't be.
In the end, all I had to do was start listening to the warning.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether the sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning at school since childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes they are better spared.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exert their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
However, there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in severe condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
"At present, a child of several months and adolescent age is lying with us," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on the mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is fed up with the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better facing the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, hey, don't you want an elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
The wife is glad because she grazes the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want for 5000, - you elephant sell.
Friend: so yeah, I'll slap myself, it's going to be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there is a giant shit everywhere, the car is dismounted, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works for its integration.
It is still operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.
It also occurred to me, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm vocabulary.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment on 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and mandarin' it is no longer clear that mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, if only I'm just a little :D
Be that as it may, it is a nonsensical demand
An earthquake of five magnitude was recorded in Tokyo.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and surrounding areas were hit by a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings in the capital were trembling, but no damage has yet been reported.
There was also no tsunami warning, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
The horrifying footage shows the moment when a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehab experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab with monkey world in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a twelve-week prison sentence with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned for life from keeping animals and has to pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on a woman's phone following a raid on her apartment over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (less than 50,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, in your freshman year, do you take away the same things you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of whipping, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch their heads and tell you they're totally in spades.
So what the fuck is this learning?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught for the lot of people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I meant absolutely seriously... ... because you just don't need to.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably due to our communist past and incitement against educated people and elites) However, the cost of having barbarians standing at our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, covid here probably never reached these proportions.
Wedding at a Glance: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions from curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
It was creaking between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was upset in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity as his now ex-wife didn't like his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, it just won't give me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In one security camera, he is captured walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, while drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.

The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
People voted for the new councils on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-Chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and staffing.
In Komne in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
The STAN list received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52 percent of voters casting their vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, also got into the council for them again.
One seat in the assembly was won by the Komňané – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the List of the Municipality for the People, which was voted for by 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular elections, won one more seat and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve yards.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was hit by rescuers of the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on concrete!
In Vítkovice caught coal.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the EMS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the infection is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Penova managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate at light weight, he showed great throttling against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored the victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt away with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pene.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", nunes did not lose for seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Penova got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock the attack away.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier fared better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the throttling away.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a masterful triumph, putting a hard right back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he recharged him with a series of precisely aimed strokes and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine, feminine or middle gender.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declensed, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an uninflected form.
For example, the words "trouble" or "hip" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the first they are declensed according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/line", "kohlrabi/kohlrabi" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inflected, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender uninflected, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There are tensions at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, says a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires, which Australia has been battling for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the inhabitants themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic repercussions, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how these people are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have money to complete
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a precarious situation.
It does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already under construction family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing well and we're going to get even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the Czech Radio Association – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO Chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What essential things have we learned?
Like in this, my diploma seems great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
State exams are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the state exams and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got it right and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
But don't overload your emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
The people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in such a way that he would put Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a spanner in the works for artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they constantly change what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been fucking me up a lot lately, so I might have to stoop to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry have had success and can't let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union – yes, broken – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On the eighth of December 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Białowieża Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one session in the Białowieża Forest what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of force".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with the idea of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat by changing its price becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
This about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like a good matrosh, full of completely useless precepts, like I should wash and not be a dick.
Too bad for paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how much of a f*ing situation they are.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship but then another half a year passed and she started to squint on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her I was breaking up and lied to her but I could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get caught up in some kind of amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Prefer to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbed by buying a cloud of tests and rushing for positives, who would not even know about this terrible disease if it were not for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under house arrest for five days.
In the West, they have stopped the antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I see that the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises to train products and business skills quickly turned into "you may not be interested, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more on how to scare and talk a person out.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to swipe a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, you learned not to jump on every bacon right away and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
There are people successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced many such things.
HR is at peace, managers are mindful of their management and do not stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form that it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will look at what came out and what did not) - it is more of a self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of a near-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched to no avail for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from the Uherské Hradiště region had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not share more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on Her way home from work on November 28, and she was supposed to collect money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, interpol listed her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police detained a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of, but did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councils were given at the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for new municipal elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
To come to terms with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its strata is what I have a problem with until now.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will make me finally less dependent on other people not being.
He would be stripped of his presidency and the capacity to regain it.
However, the chance that this will actually happen is very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I am not sure that the discarding of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they haven't had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them saying they have been sexless in the past year in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious disposition also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided by the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts that trend," Stone says of the thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, most importantly, social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without a job or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order for a COVID vaccine is about whether society should force part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's quite a difficult question, which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we do not order them to do so and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an octogenarian who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination who, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, is shouting something about bullying and the totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizerská fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about the gentleman.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and who we probably don't see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but he and a friend started talking.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially triggered the migrant crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun crashed into the vehicle and asked for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after discovering that she had more than two per mille in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog darlings.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the Dog That Taught People to Live, another film Here We Watch is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some well-known characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, so they start inviting dog owners, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he just determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital,  so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog could take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the pension will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits naked and make-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and chatter as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression is down-to-date.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parts, they do not have much to play.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzzwords, let alone the more vernacular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a bit too much erotica and a minimum of a sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It is a job like any other, in which case a brigade for extra earnings.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for israel's Water Management Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
On the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, tankers are increasing.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes broke out in Isfahan, Iran, between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I the lady a little and grilled her during a conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I spent a moment with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
Downhill skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out on cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people went to jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare praise the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech News Agency.
"We have only seen incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater strain is expected in the period of ski courses.
David Šinták, Managing Director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, great demand is recorded by the rental in the Novako area in Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election at all.
If life here is stupid, then some traditional V4 madman can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Mp Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably scared to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family, and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in '38 is off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
Suburban train transport will be served by S7 trains, which pass through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will newly stop the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines extending into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and operations will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka was also established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when express line number 404 will newly depart.
Lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of ten Central Bohemian local lines has been cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko, is being extended.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy at most pizza buns and a snack yogurt and apple.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from riding off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of Gifts about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been dragging it together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she has kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer to her ears.
But apparently he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it jumps out of the can on them, or those whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or you insist that everyone really knows the list of your former partners in detail and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's žúžo, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there for a long time as vice-president of the Football Club Juventus.
They went out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been separated on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are also just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything essential, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly does not hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., this is quite a bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides, it is close to most but faculties (I do not know where exactly you are going).
So I have never been looking for a rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own pocket, or let them go according to the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he throws a few crowns into a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier had made such comments about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone going to have an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would consult you directly with the person who assigned you the work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and into the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own emblem that fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Oder Kingdom than an Odryan Empire?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our Presidency will be.
This is a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, so confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we were always talking, so christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy Dáda and Lucie something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And are we Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and far between, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and smaller rainfall is recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture so far.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it will be so, I can barely keep myself in skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also overall hallucinations.
And whether you are a hockey team "copper Russia" or "lama China" so lose by two goals even if you do not have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the referees do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic 1967 are at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK's Health Safety Authority, said on Television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister defended that the quiz was taken "virtually", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, there is growing pressure to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by an overwhelming majority.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can they be expected to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They are unlikely to be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of parliament and one of Fidesz's leaders, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, telling intelligence chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has her for a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and it was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me a slap in the face, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, as a child I was quite fighting, now I hit at least something to discharge and as younger I slapped my parents on the hand for example (so as not to get too much over the hold), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my explosiveness, but certainly the upbringing has a part to play in it.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just something, it's probably not possible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why op should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call pussies those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial begins with the four accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his links to the top slovak politicians and the judiciary.
How crucial will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and the company bounced it off.
There were deaths on Czech television with covid half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of repositories nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their possibilities in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is reproached by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a factual plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for a repository.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but it is the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit to decide.
Any action shall not have suspensive effect on the execution of the exploration or construction work.
The codecision of local authorities requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with havel & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following the contracts with attorney-at-law Jan Zemánek.
According to the Register of Contracts, the total amount for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman of the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in search of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in a similar way as the municipalities directly affected in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to a deep geological repository.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman ( 69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is simply significant for the story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since December 7.
Through Interpol, he is also helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of it.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in posting leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the year drew to a close.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively scans for stored credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to be behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of estimating around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That is, there are a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I would argue that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found common ground.
Only anti-vandals, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this discontent depends not only on the money inflow, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists of which humanity is rightly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
Of the "secretly" captured footage, it is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about the children's hospital worker is also being called by her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person that his paintings violated copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of the Little Mole in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the RMD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole was still there.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
The big return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could be in goal soon.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the game, he played with Vegas and has not played on an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred while the veteran goalkeeper was moving from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,” the Denver unit announced in early October.
His return to the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
An inmate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had a hip problem in his senior year and didn't catch a single game in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, Francik made 36 catches, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photograph of himself helping his wife Camille to put on her mask at the races.
This was reported on the BBC's website.
They send their wishes to the friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte is dressed in it.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas card on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches the color of her pale dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accusation that the former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He told efotbal.cz that he had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the reds and whites had not committed any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police intercepts in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, features mainly.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then minor league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbro a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to forensics, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Hardman has denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the intercepts, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR, in mid-October last year.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvps are Cold War larping.
The guns would be new, but essentially of a worse type (artillerymen had to carry cartridges by hand without cover from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small, short-range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
AF: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I got a wank right outside of town.
Nutrients were crawling out of the river, doing damage to crops, so I was there once.
As I approached, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but of course after a while the fox went.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman was shitting himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was for a fox.
By the time I got off the perch, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So in a visible place, put the expensive stuff at your feet in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
I.A. found respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities were economical?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of iRozhlas, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of ČSLA that older generations have experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained can take, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is getting more complex, so the ability of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic will fight only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography.
We don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations where you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago drive into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss guys and you think, "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they treat him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "taking on a defender" is so terrible that I find myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker has managed to play off one of his opponents.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is well known: the omicron variant, which is most likely spreading faster than the current Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from a previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected plus-side phenomenon has also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalizations by one third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first shipments of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As stated, Merck’s molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up first on the tape because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak has grown".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing your job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both polled at over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of rotating units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads, because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on a carrier device.
Except for the museum maple, the rest are in disrepair.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was a little overbearing, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everybody talked to him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was very close, he was regular, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he wore clean clothes.
He went to school in the outdoors, did all sorts of shenanigans, but he was fine, probably never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, joined the same class, another class.
Shortly thereafter, a teacher was beaten up, police were often involved, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an advertisement (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold often to Gypsies, they've always had the money, they didn't try to get me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car that way, the guy called in a month later and said he'd signed it over to him.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just common behavior).
But when someone comes in, they reach out, they empty out apartments and houses, they're just a mess, they cause trouble... no matter what color they are, I don't care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," spokesperson for the South Bohemian medical rescue workers Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons yet to be determined, he turned in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, the accident was described by the spokesperson of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he has to add VAT and forward data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail telling him that customs is expecting the package.
It is then sufficient to fill in the details of the consignment and, if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will charge it on the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the addressee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and filled in on time, we would be about half there," says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, a raise (who is the employee)?
I got a 2% raise in gross this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even six months?
This just blows my mind, how can a court send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover.
Won't this also deter potential future rape reports from victims?
The man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped officers secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He had summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after the 911 call, and were surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to arrive at the scene.
In fact, all he wanted from the officers was advice on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, a nationwide manhunt, and was subject to an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavic ethnically or culturally, but I would like your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in one of those thousands of religions who will punish you badly if you believe in another.
But even in the Ten Commandments there is no god but Yahweh.
In that case, wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I didn't just hit sending me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training followed by reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All the forces of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is continuous, each of us constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German, or even a Mongol invader will never come here again.
​I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if we get into trouble.
Oh, my God.
One election in the U.S. that cuts their budget, and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just have to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that can master the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, any teenager can fly a remote control device, so I don't know what to do.
We don't need border fortifications, that's a bitch these days, but a pimply teenager behind the wheel of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You open your gifts under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're home stuffed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is being re-used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This has created a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is therefore a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the shop involved (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, it also strengthens my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Individuals and businesses together make us a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added to help find uses for things that would otherwise become useless waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean Up the Czech Republic.
It seems wrong to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency over the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron’s supporters, straddling the right and left, agree on little, but they agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for head of state in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticize Macron for his pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now, arguing that the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler during World War II was not so bad, and has had some success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history book seriously, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us-versus-them story and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they had an enlightened teacher, they would never know what the larger context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he stayed on the first rung of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.

Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
Starting on Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, the departure time will be adjusted only, or their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services daily, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be operated daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections under the new timetable, the runways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
Czech Railways will replace the carrier after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
A total of 16 services will be operated daily by RegioJet, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by the German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in the schools that the blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one teaches you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, but everywhere they tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, while we're on the subject of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some good successes of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people idolize it these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaver, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and perhaps our view doesn't exist with them (there was also a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires in 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that some of the universities were appalling, the students were quite radicalised, and the schools often encouraged them to do so.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, so other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side as well, often leading to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't seen anyone condemn me for colonialism or slavery either.
Rather, I encountered the wrong geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of a personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some shit about the coronavirus that makes everyone ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they attend services to the Hussites because it's a lot like that in theology, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even have a Latin Mass every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. like they did in front of Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the squad and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said Girl Scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing point in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the Boy Scouts take the train to Vienna to pick him up.
There is no change in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the Scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where it will be handed over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be handled by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Boy Scouts must comply with the measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible," said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the faithful, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will put the money to good use, but I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and interferes with the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that's giving jobs to people, this is holding back a development where this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone.
I totally agree, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age gets caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm moved by online ads, but then I catch myself that they've affected me, too - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising.
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this belief has its roots in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'm going to say is cryptic thinking."
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with 200 of them premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend for Christmas movies, presenting a record of more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas, family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences and increasing the audience significantly, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, there were four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those pictures that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday films in reality.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love in the Sky and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real Christmas boom did not start until 2009, when Hallmark, an American cable television station, came up with a special film series, the BBC pointed out.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter all that much, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray said.
For example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, resolves and the two of them kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another," Gray adds.
Mazepin had positive text on covid-19, he will not interfere in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to be attacking a better position from the 20th place he had finished in qualifying.
But Russia's Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last rung and Max Verstappen first to face Lewis Hamilton in a straight title battle.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepine is relatively healthy and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or a driving session at another part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not deal with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had a covid-19 at the start of the season, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
They can arrest you for that, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater impresses!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, they never wore sweaters much at home,” confesses Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend to be washed.
And there's another problem.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as fast as I can," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

They are to assist Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.

The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another kid from Adam's.
"Currently we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's prep class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
No one has ever traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron.
None of them had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone living abroad.

California will restrict the sale of guns.
He wants to do the same thing as Texas on abortion.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit brought by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsome’s announcement responded to the US Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that kept Texas’s abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US until roughly the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In fact, enforcement of the ban in this case has been made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block federal review of their laws, California will use that power to protect lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on a measure authorising public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This refers to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and legal costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state did indeed reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas ban on abortion full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
For example, studies on the effects of a 4-dose dose are already pouring in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, she'll have her vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market shortly.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, it would be against the law for the European Commission to use the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland’s plan to draw €36 billion from the EU’s Recovery Fund for the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictation by blackmail and by trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels as would result in Poland's sovereignty being curtailed.
"We will never agree to Poland being a colony," he said.
But knowing about it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes on the milk shelves, I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector all the choice, less common and special cheeses were there, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to, I won't even go to the store anymore, action or no action, golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and there's an order to it, so I'm done in ten minutes.

Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I got a few punches on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and to the extent) is beneficial, because the child responds to it much more than words.
What's important, I think, is the warning part, because it kind of gives the kid the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, responded to a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred charter on which he is sworn and about which he has been taught in school since he was a child, or an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was decidedly in favour of the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and make them more economical with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we impose bans on politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told News.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place in a clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
Children with postcovidius syndromes were in the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covidal pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“We currently have a child of several months and adolescent age with us,” said the head doctor.
He is pleased, however, that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any deaths from the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in a children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus ward - it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovidius syndrome.
“Therefore, the administration of the vaccine dose is recommended in children as well,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside of the marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's awesome.
The wife is happy because she eats the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the kids play with it.
That's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Buddy: All right, high five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
Lawn trampled, giant shit everywhere, car split, kids scared of it, and wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold says: you speak ill of an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course for international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm a quibbler.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
Let me take an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for “Spanish fruit and mandarins” it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is “all American forces” including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already covered in the broad term, and there's no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.
A magnitude 5 earthquake has been recorded in Tokyo.
A magnitude 5.0 earthquake struck the Japanese capital Tokyo and surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses reported buildings trembling in the capital, but no damage has been reported.
A tsunami warning was not issued either, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before being flushed down the toilet by its callous owner and laughed at.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life, and must pay the equivalent of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered gruesome footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her apartment on a drug charge.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanily.
In the next video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house, she found £1,600 worth of cocaine hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, freshman year, you're gonna take the same stuff you took in sixth grade?
And it's all being killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just take the test at 1 and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority of them don't give a shit and tell you they're completely fucked.
Then what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want and don't need.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine, I was totally serious about it... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In our country, our communist past and our persecution against the educated and the elites probably contribute to this) But the cost of having barbarians standing by the machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid here would probably never have reached this size.
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to inquisitive questions from curious fans about what had disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it from her social media.
Kadri and Andrea had been on edge since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move out with her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect, even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri said angrily, responding to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
Even his younger sister, Linda, didn't like the supposed sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on things like that at all, and even in my family, we've never said much of those things.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't get it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I'm even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else, and we know the reality and we know the truth, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery in a residential parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
A security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the landlord woke up in the morning, he found the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed the money, drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business.
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right of assembly will be restricted but not abolished.
More than 60% of voters turned out for Saturday's municipal elections.
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 candidates for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies," said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic had made elections more difficult in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komni, Hungary, the Independent Candidates' Association won Saturday's election, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means she won two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52% of the electorate giving them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privately.
One seat in the council was won by Komňany – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters turned out.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimovsk, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, making it four out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia na Mostecku were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.

59.88% of voters voted for the Independent Candidates Association, giving them four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, won one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I resent how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived hitting the concrete.
An incredible fall on Sunday night was survived by a man in Ostrava, who was attended by rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, the Regional Operations Center responded to a distress call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a 27-year-old man was supposed to fall out of a window from a height of about 40 feet and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should have been, and the fire department went in.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of death.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the next care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than I am about the coronavirus, about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Cutter.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña has beaten legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he did a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France was also victorious, beating Cody Garbrandt by a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight contest between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary dwarf, for Nunes had not lost in seven years, and she was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to knock her down.
Peña, however, did not allow herself to be forced into any more errors and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with the hand lever.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both combatants landed a number of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peña got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier was better off, but gradually the tide began to turn.
In the other, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
He didn't do that very well, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to beat the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a brilliant victory against Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of well-aimed punches and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes had another triumph with her little daughter, and now, after seven years, she had lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns with which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two houses.
They then take on dual terminals during declension and in some cases remain in the non-inclined form.
For example, the words "wriggle" or "hip" are of both male and female gender, in the former they are slanted according to the pattern "machine", in the latter they are slanted according to the pattern "song".
For the other group of nouns, the shapes are already different in the first instance of the singular, for example: ‘row/row’, ‘kohlrabi/kohlrabi’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-scriptural, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some of the words that came into Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but they gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained rigid in the middle genus, but has endings in the male genus along the lines of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way towards the southern borders of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we choked, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has faced for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic fallout, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to have to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to avoid it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how those people are often treated by their neighbors or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the allegations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sex offenders.
Czech Republic floods with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
It put a lot of people in a tough spot.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished houses and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete already-under-construction family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into unfinished houses.
In a worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three single-family houses in a year, and fifty percent of us do.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earnings," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of the construction company.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had expected the house to cost them five million, now it would cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," Sullivan added.
Copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
“The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're good, and we're gonna be even better.
But there is no real vision, says ČRO commentator – myRozhlas
Beyond the traditional celebrations, the entrance to the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As in, I find my thesis cool right now, I have my own topic that I've chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a year, and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Statehouses are very quiet in our country, unless you're a total maverick and you've got something left in your head, the committee won't stifle you with a theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State Department, and when I was at my wit's end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical inference, which I immediately realized, and I got it right.
Anyway, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's cool if at the end of the course there's an exam that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
But don't overload your e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may not have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, or something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Pooh Bear statue.
You need to put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta is giving artists a hard time.
If you don't give the stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's pissed me off lately, so I might have to stoop to the tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my line of work have been successful and they're not even close to letting it happen.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly to come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement by the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union - yes, broken - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the Belovezhsky Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open and lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that “the Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With a stroke of a pen, they “abolished” a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in a single session in the White Forest had betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, ripped off fourteen republics from the world's greatest power that had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today, mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not be directly correlated with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK/kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit about how if something's cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or poor is very retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
I went to Brno recently and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take this kind of stuff to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the workings of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected she was some kind of agitator.
After I finished reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lectures, like washing up and not being a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to indulge this person because you love him without even realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd cry and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked in the head.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from running amok again.
Such a person will drain you of feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are frantically stealing in by buying a bunch of tests and rushing the positives, who wouldn't even know about the horrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is complicating things for companies, carriers, and others because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the West, they had stopped their antics and accepted that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Valek's new, and he's got some thieving to do, and he's got to drive his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we've got some good old-fashioned trash coming back.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "don't worry about it, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered, as I wanted to help people, but the training sessions were more about scaring and talking people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to whip up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only ones that made you feel like a pot salesman.
What I can tell you is that the experience was valuable, and you learned not to jump on the bandwagon and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even useful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business and they don't stick their noses in anything.
So the regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that it's going on with us it's pretty good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what came out and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone judging you by any numbers, that sort of thing.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works, so they don't bother us much as long as the results are in.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
My condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28, coming home from work, and she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her work colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Interpol reported her missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but she did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councils were created at the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 valid candidates for the 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
They registered the highest interest in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for the 28 council posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put more demands on equipment and personnel security," Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while at the very beginning to come to terms with the fact that we had a fairly dangerous contagious disease, but there were no major hitches.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all its levels, that's what I'm having trouble with until now.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening, however, are very slim, as others here have pointed out.
Besides, I'm not sure that shredding a file would even qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who have reported that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One could be the economic impact of a coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, has also contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people; by 2021, only 5% of them said they had not had sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
While spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that they are a minority among the single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is pushing the trend," Stone says of this thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious," the trend went from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people with no or lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of mandating vaccination against covids is whether society should force a section of the population into behaving that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, then it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have been responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get inoculated, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think we are responsible for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they'll really have themselves to blame.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent years.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for combating drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a religious man.
One day in high school, our teacher took us all the way across town to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we went down one of these quite wide streets, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but he and a friend got talking.
When she left, my teacher and I asked her what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she said.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After earlier visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must collectively make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border should be addressed through diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy Group, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially created the migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegally).
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her license for failing to give right of way and for fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her license after they found out she had a blood alcohol level of over two.
At the same time, she was told that she would be confessing her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovič, however, did not guard his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But what they forgot was the essential thing: the rules of the movie business.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, another film called Here We Guard is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Sajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here I Guard from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some of the familiar figures around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava boarding house, which is dying, so they start to invite dog-walkers, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also a producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's review.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing field trip with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, who falls into a coma, and is then taken away from the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of dog healing can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against nature's cleansing cure and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a doggie contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops coming to a tip-off in search of “drugs” and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs – and which, of course, the baked family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma, and then sits perfumed and made-up with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, he explains to the viewer that “that sometimes happens after a coma.”
Sajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to build load-bearing situations, feeling for characters and punch lines, and direction.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomko and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog-talk, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters perpetrate.
The argument is not even the age-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man and dog there must be a knowledge of craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and not enough feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurish stunt would fail.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that crap all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in my case a part-time job.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost total absence of precipitation during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the right Christmas setting, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, and is occasional and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater resource, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring with the last three rainy winters.
It's been dropping ever since.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"Depending on global warming and climate change, it can be expected that precipitation may decrease," Israel Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
Tank trucks are piling up on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"My orders are up seventy to eighty percent this year compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary of State Benny Gantz said Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had produced “no progress” and that world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing games with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been prying and grilling the young lady in conversation to see what she wants me to do.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these tricks, I continued to annoy the lady with doubts and questions for a while, and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a thug, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snow at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operation as a result.
The skiers were not dissuaded by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about customer indifference, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region took to cross-country skiing tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna on Šumpersk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are awesome.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not spare praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell the ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents," René Hroneš from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski centre told the Czech Press Agency.
"We've only seen incident units," he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
He expects a greater surge in the ski course season.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that because of the covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By now, before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
People, he said, had become lazy with the pandemic and had learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental agency in the Novako complex on Boží Dar is experiencing great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
“We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a good life here, as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people go abroad who have no property here.
A business owner doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election.
If life's bad here, some traditional V4 freak might win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can't be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmayer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for the shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she worked here for our health service," Harman said.
Police had earlier arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine that way.
These are not "huge quantities" but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we exaggerate the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons with the situation in '38 are off at so many points, I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will be faced with several changes starting on Sunday, particularly concerning suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed routes, and others ceased to exist.
Mladá Boleslav is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, the fast trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains run from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague's main railway station.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will be newly stopped by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, there will be buses to Svetlana nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
With integration, 77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational lines will be adapted.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague Zličín, which will run all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
The morning rush hour and the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník will be reinforced, when the express line number 404 will start.
Lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on a dozen local lines in Central Bohemia is newly cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
Routes 540 to 543 on Nymburk have been changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only place to get food is next door to Billy's or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy only pizza, buns and a snack of yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, I'm afraid.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from skiing off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been going steady since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has missed the fact that Dara has captured a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
She said he picked her up, not the other way around.
They've been the center of attention for three days, and although they're used to public attention, they're not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't give a damn and it's popping out of the can, or us whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if one of you wants an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are suited to each other, or if you insist that everyone really knows the details of your ex-partners and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was visiting to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been a long-term vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They were coming clean now, waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but they had not been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We, too, are only human, with families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commentators have probably said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to begin with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides it is close to most faculties of BUT (I don't know exactly where you are going).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
But this is an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can teach whatever they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they can follow the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full state contribution and can learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a man who, two days before, had said so about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it in the eye somehow, or write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I wouldn't exactly recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a good, dedicated student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'm guessing the author or the printer simply created his own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't that the Odrynian Empire rather than the Odrynian Empire?
Shh. Somebody already cracked this place for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'topic' of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is amusing.
All the important approvals are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with the English thing, it's kind of interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Ceil.
It's my third year working there, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive home from work at 10:00 at night and never have a problem?
Only someone who's never set foot in a ghetto can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't :And it's certainly not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Dada and the lover Gelema as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen this wreath, and I'm sure Lucy has one, too," the saxophonist told Lightning, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annie, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something for both Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video launch at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know any other ingredients that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Policemen are few and cannot afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and there has been less precipitation in places where there has been no shortage of water.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage land also amplifies the impact.
Prepare for what in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's the way it is, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total hoot, too.
And whether you're a "Russia Bear" hockey team or a "China Lama" hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they skewer, what the referees notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And even if it were the other way around, it's the same as always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Office of Health Security, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection, and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz was "virtual", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
This will be an election of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
Not fair.
Nor are they likely to be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be a question not of whether Fidesz would win, but of how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security, was leaked to independent media.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
Everything starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, and they took me to the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me educatively, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight quite a bit when I was a kid, now I hit something for discharges, and when I was younger I slapped my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get too much of a punch), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, maybe it's impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
Kundami, then, I would call those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a blackout?
Can we really count on people wanting and buying the product and you'll have something to pay the mortgage with?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four accused of the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has stirred up civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the leaders of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a break will the process be for Slovakia?
This is all the fault of the press.
How is it possible that this petition got an order of magnitude more media attention than the anti-petition by the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled, and the company took the fall.
Czech TV was dying of covid six months ago.
Another government shuts down and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is missing.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental overhaul.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected when choosing and permitting a deep-sea repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delay.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the Act a stronger strengthening of their possibilities when deciding on the repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the site selection for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a substantive plan almost completely ignores public involvement and makes municipal citizens practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of locating and selecting the site for the repository, its authorisation and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a site for a repository.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they make comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or the minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
An action, if any, shall have no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of self-government that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice-mayor of Cejle municipality from Hrádek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Though he hadn't felt the need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he'd been spooked by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a college text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
Plus, there's more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the "boss" is kind of like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan is interesting, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for a story or game, a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all the others and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been wanted since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow memo about her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech Police is working closely with the British Police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra was announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
The MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We're very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
It's not clear who he is or what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month's attacks intensified significantly as the year ended.
We had a big campaign on Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
So far, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
An infected attachment in an e-mail is meant to draw the user's attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November caught rather global campaigns.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months, recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity.
Today's demo of brainiacs who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sections of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-dragons and associates couldn't have filled or paid for a parade this big.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are growing in popularity, reminding me of A Million Moments for an Upside-Down Democracy.
Sometimes I think they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It won't be a left-wing or a centre-left movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to have a booster every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant scientific achievement of which mankind is justly proud.
End of stalemate: Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The country’s political crisis has been ongoing since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
"Secret" footage is a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived is also calling for information on the staff of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The Šumperská amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the county pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous tipster to be violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court accepted that the paintings of Mole in the rooms of Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was life and death.
The Municipality referred complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gape.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month the RMD began to "intensively address the situation".
There is a great return to the Czech Resolution.
Paul Francis was professed to NHL
The Czech ice hockey guard Pavel Franciz, who passes through his career in recent months, returns back to the NHL.
The one-year-old Pilsen family will be on the skier and soon it could reach the gate.
Former guard Lytvínová, Pilsen or Czech Republic injured in preparation for the NHL this October.
Just in the middle of the match with Vegas, he has not been represented at the NHL glides since then.
The incident occurred when an experienced guard moved from one rod to another.
"Pavel Francis will be outside about three to four weeks with injuries at the bottom of the body," said Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL gate lasted for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was professed from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AGL, 94.5% of the procedures were added.
The Pilsen Hockey League wants to finally accommodate and confirm that it belongs to the world’s best league.
In the last year he had problems with cycling and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch the only match.
In the NHL "Francek" took 36 matches, its success is 92.3%.
Charles deploys Camille empire, William and Kate in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
His wishes were also published by Prince Charles, who used a photo on which his cabinet Camille helps to deploy a knight.
The British BBC news station was informed on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, collaborators and foundations they cooperate with.
The photo was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and dresses also have Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, has as well as Prince George and Louis shorts and t-shirt with collar.
Who has taken the photo, William and Kate have not reported, it is not clear when exactly created.
Last year, the royal family for photography designed as a Christmas wish invited a package of straws before the accumulation of wood in its countryside seat in Norfolk County.
The image that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by the successor to the throne of Prince Charles with his wife Camilly.
Photographer himself Hussein captured them in June at the reaches of Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on the head and on the face of the empire, helps Camille deploy her empty color matching with light dresses.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbrový million for a title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague – Crimeans in the current corruption caucus allegedly worked with the accusation of former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for a league title in 2018/19 season from Prague Slavia.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he got to part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Urshow club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that no corruption negotiations were red.
The server published a transcription of police hearings in which Slavia is mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer in the master club.
The former influential functionary of the Red Whites was, according to the writer, in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
The criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbrova promised a financial reward for receiving a title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) of the SK Slavia Prague functionalists had a million fees for winning the league, quoted the server from the list.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavia Tvrdik.
There is no longer anything from the list, according to the server, whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He rejected the claim of any corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the attitudes in Czech football and offered an opposite alternative to its development.
We have never initiated illegal negotiations, did not seek to influence arbitrators in contradiction with fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context," said Tvrdik for the List of Reports.
In posts, among other things, Nezmar is not choosing to insult some former players of Slavia dark skin, as well as the prayer of his former Tvrdik's chef.
In mid-October, Kauza allegedly influenced the matches through the arbitrators, the police intervention in several locations, including the Prague FACR.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, which no longerfigures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse (the shooter must be made of a pancerated cabin and carry the charges manually without covering).
Cars - Toyoti hi-lux - are new and good
Loaders and various pancer vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - small and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I'm gonna beside the city.
From the river climbed nutrition and damaged crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that on the second bank of the river there was a fisherman.
I didn't want to make bordles, so I sat in peace and probably didn't notice the tip.
I hoped that he would leave before something was going out, but of course in a moment the fragment went.
I let her come for 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman sprinkled, had heads on all sides, so I called on him that it was on a frage.
Before I tear out of the possession was a fuch.
I mean, I like a man to be a pigtail.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be played a lot of accidents to become something, probably you would be seen in the thermal vision that has almost everyone today.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put your feet in the sleeping and you should be cool.
Vojtach versus Hamaček.
Inside the respirators found significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of reefs, masks and respirators for the professions of the nearest coronavirus has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks.
The iRozglas server compared the purchases of individual ministers and found that within one day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why others bought the road?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of iRozglas Dominika Kubištová server.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (probably I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were made by the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military.
We do not even have large warehouses of techniques that could be captured, we do not actually have modern technique or for existing professionals, in addition, modern technique is still more complex, so the ability of the founders will quickly lose in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where someone can deploy, will take place very quickly, will not be the time to exercise someone again.
Finally, founding/territorial defence is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead the mass heril and it is also expressed the need to regret the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will only be conducted in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the heroes will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
mainly, we do not have individual skills.
This is not even the worst.
The worst is that the half of them plays like if they had it.
This will then happen to a situation that you look like a fraer who didn't crash the empty gate back 2 minutes, go into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and say "tvl and what are you probably thinking to happen now?".
Well, of course, will elect him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this ability to "behave a defender" is so terrible that I am surprised sincerely when I see that our attacker could play one opponent.
First arrangement
Covid's pandemic slows down, but experts don't expect a major return for the next weeks.
The pressure in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time, and the pandemic equation was added, as well as known, to the new unknown: the variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet absolutely sure to say whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or poststinphic immunity can help against it obtained prior to the disease.
However, this week the unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antivirotic molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a paxlovid medicine from Pfizer, which is even 85 per cent of the results.
However, the first supplies of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As it was said, first of all, Merck's molnupiravir will be available to domestic patients.
The company ended on the tape as the first, even because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic was launched to find suitable treatment for viral horse diseases in the South American continent.
For this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often concerned.
They are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and in particular Czechs, are accustomed to speaking "how we have grown up".
See a research where people ask whether they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will say that they are not.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we are Czech racist beasts.
And then go and choose the parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancelling culture, saying this in the public means losing work and media link.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the West is good, the east is poor.
But find out what people think.
It is only in France Le Pen and Zemmir, both have more than 20% according to the survey.
Even we know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the rotation of units so that soldiers do not have to learn where they are, all objects are the same.
Of one, Atom Brda Museum and the remaining two are abandoned.
Sranda is that sssr did not have a nuclear head on its own territory, whether for safety or speed of deployment of heads because of a more Western position.
In those underground covers (in each picture there are two) only the heads were kept not the whole missile as they say.
If it was necessary to install this weapon, a special unit was arrived, which picked up this head and mounted on some bearing devices.
In addition to the museum painting, they are left in a desolated state.
At the second stage of primary school, we had a Gypsy colleague, 4 years we were with him.
It was quite fine, he did good fun, often too much manifested, but it was such our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, lacked little, walked regularly, sports worked with us, did not steal snacks, neither phones, walked purely garmented.
He went to schools in nature, made different opponents, but was cool, perhaps never a gap.
In the eighth or ninth class, they entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly, the teacher left, solved something by police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have already sold to Gypsies, the money has always been, they didn't try to attract me to the price, communication in peace.
I even sold this car as well, the boy in a month called that it was already overwritten..
I say about myself that I am not racial, I am one if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, until it behaves as in a decent society (works, works, women of heaven, just normal behavior).
But as somebody comes, pulls his hand, washs out the apartments and houses, has only an inconvenience around him, makes problems... so it's one that has a color, but it's worth me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they are involved, start businessing, working, learning language (not necessary, at least English), respecting our culture.
If I believe in Allah, it is one thing to me until I respect my tradition and culture, I will also be there.
Young woman died in the accident of cars in Prachatice
"Youth woman suffered serious numerous injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she was injured on the site," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for Southern Healthcare.
The accident probably failed the driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle is likely to move from the village of Žichovec to the village of Bavorov and, for undiscovered reasons, went to the opposite direction.
After the collapse, Škoda Octavia ended with the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the road, described the accident spokesperson for South Bohemian police Stephen Schwarz.
The young Peugotu driver suffered very serious injuries.
It was numerous injuries and remained spelled in the car.
After dismissal, she had to be provided with acute pre-Democracy care and in a stable state he was transported to the Czech Budapest Hospital, according to Fajtlová’s rescue officer.
She added that a man from the second car suffered lighter injuries to the chest and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not supply data
Lukáš Neuheisl orders abroad several times a month.
He organizes mainly collector cards.
“Usually it can be dozens of dollars, we’ll tell you, from ten dollars, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where it’s often free of charge,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small shipments has been slightly irritated, new VAT must be added and mailed to customs proceedings.
He will receive an email with the message that customs expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the shipment data, and if VAT has not included a merchant in the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide customs proceedings alone, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the entire process is not complicated.
I call one or two check boxes, I insert two attachments and I'm ready.
For me it is mostly a five-minute question, says Neugeisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rule, the daily number of shipments received from abroad declined to the international post in Prague from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the delivery of data that are necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments to be processed on international mail.
If people complete all the data they need and fill them in time, so we would be about half here, says the spokesperson for the Czech Post Matiaš Vítik.
Inflation solutions
See the subtitle, how would you suggest solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% of inflation and are expected to grow further.
What should the state do, according to you, to slow or compensate for this growth?
Do we see a reduction in VAT for food and PHM in Poland, is this way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it sleeps?
Prices grow faster than they pay, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, mainly energy.
How many you have received, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year I was added to 2% in gross, which is laughing, but fortunately I have a similar income from businesses that operate at work.
Would someone be able to explain why provenly convinced violents send themselves behind the grid for only 6 months?
This head simply does not know how the court can only send for 6 months such animal behind the grid only to do it again as it comes out.
6 The month is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relations in general.
And this does not mention that the victim of rape may never be remembered.
Doesn't this disagree with the potential future reports of rape to the victim?
A man from Grobe "burned" his girlfriend from Costomlat
A man from Groba unwillingly helped the guardians to ensure his national search for a girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was ordered to arrest.
He himself called them to her.
He went to the calls.
He first appealed to the surrounding and thought that he was stolen.
After calling to the emergency line, the guardians arrived at the place and were not enough to see when they allegedly said that they all thought that guards would arrive at the place.
In fact, he wanted to advise guardians on how to submit notifications to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the guardians found that the woman was on the list of searched persons, in a national search, and arrest order was issued.
The case therefore deals with the CDM.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally speaking for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with me that the damage that Churchill was not able to ensure the liberation of the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
But I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without proof just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case personally as a right faith.
Here I can't agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world if I don't weave something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will irreparably punish you if you believe in another god.
However, it is in the tenth that there is no god other than Jahveh.
Therefore, it would not be more rational to refrain from faith in any god than risking that of the thousands of gods to choose wrong and that one real god I did not treat, will send me to hell or to a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X-months of training (in different specializations, X-months per one) and under the leadership of professions with practical experience.
If a person knows well, he can get a professional offer.
All ingredients of the Czech Republic would fit something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say as follows: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry has continued to be mistaken, the company hunts at schools and takes place some delay when the labour force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only adolescents, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar penetration should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, German or, for example, Mongolian rider will never proceed here.
It will come funny to me, as you consider NATO to be something pulled out into the stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if there is a gap.
But you'll delight the panba.
Just one election in the United States that will cry out their budget and the whole NATO goes to learning.
The English exchanges us for Russian dust, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Police once turned out to show them back and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence is armed army after the teeth and the population who can control the military equipment of their time.
And today they can pilot remote control of the means of each teenager so that it would not happen.
We don't need border fortification, this is today to come, but hang the teenager behind the remote controlled device.
How not to drown in box tsunami
Do you wrap gifts under a Christmas tree and at once you are filled with boxes and fillings at home?
This "waste" re-uses e-shops that miss packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops was created, which your boxes used welcome.
And not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, the damage to them is treated as a disposable waste.
Anyone can, upon agreement, bring to the interconnected trade (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and avoid overfilled blue containers.
Shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently insufficient in the market and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard has irritated by 50% over the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, they strengthen their brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling materials to us in Popovek near Brno by individuals who collect at home are also asked to us by companies with which we have agreed regularly shifted cardboards.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more comprehensive world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature with other generations, says Petra Lopushnikova from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only shopping places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (when to deduct sorted waste from the household, where to deduct passed medications, tyres, supplied electrics, batteries, light sources, large waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, in addition, reuseable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project contains over 100,000 such places.
"Successfully, collective courts, reuse centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste," Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklidme Czech Association, adds.
Speak me badly that today technology is so simple and fluffy that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones simply hide the underlying file system with folders and all uploads to one screen in the app.
Quietly, let’s use technology from childhood, but especially let’s learn something.
Let's write history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they should not be prosecuted in a half year.
However, French politicians like it and like voters.
Macron supporters of the intersection between the right and the left match little, but just Europe yes.
And in France, new elections will be the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, inter alia, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to the criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, this is trying to defend rewritten history rather.
The extremely right-wing candidate for French President Eric Zemmir is now circumventing France with the fact that the regime of Vichy, who collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad and has quite a success with the French.
Try to take Macron's idea of one textbook of history seriously and regardless of the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story to me versus them and never as a story in general.
Spanish, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they do not have an illuminated cantor, they will no longer know what was the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mouses" did not win.
The story that returns to the Massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 was also awarded awards for directors and for the best actress Jasn Duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held the first stages of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the Father's film.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.

Christmas book types
The Christmas double number, which will be released on December 20, will contain a traditional literary attachment.
And along with it, cultural tips will go.
In addition to this digital edition, the books are available to you, subscribers, so that you may have enough time to get books like Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petriček Sellier & Petriček Bellot.

In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
Telling about the return to the roots, which will only be drawn illusion.

And that the way back to instincts is shorter than a person is willing to admit
The author in his last novel tells about a rather less sentimental story of returning from emigration than we were able to listen to.
Those who remained, and those who left, know too little about themselves to give it to a common life.
Trains begin to ride according to a new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains start to the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some tracks, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet begins to ride instead of the Czech roads.
For most lines only modify the departure time, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the colleges.
The carriers started selling tickets in autumn.
Czech railways plan to tell on average 6783 passenger transport connections daily on average of 478 remote trains.
The train runs around 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
The roads alongside national connections under the new schedule will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, has dozens of new trains.
The main news will be Interet trains that will ride on lines from Prague to Cheba.
Another new train carrier will explore in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the price of the ticket from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
The roads take into account inflation into their tariffs every year.
The largest change in RegioJet’s timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Melník – Nimburk – Kolín.
After success in the competition, the Ministry of Transport will replace the Czech Railways.
Daily RegioJet will tell a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped in the stations of Havličkov Brod, Ždar nad Sazavou and Cologne since Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two backbone connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the speaker Emil Selarik, the carrier tried to preserve the most similar time of travel of his remote trains despite the planned extraction work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier is also replaced in some regional routes.
The changes are waiting for passengers to Czechoslovakia, for example, where trails from Mladá Boleslav through the Czech Lipa to Rumburk will ride instead of the Czech trails Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use uniform railway tickets for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price increases by 3.2% inflation.
I have to disagree.
Perhaps we will not learn the view of the other side?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were pushed and had to drill, died.
In my life I have not heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
Nobody will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold to slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
Nobody teaches you that colonizers often bought soil from Indians everywhere, just tell you how brutal we, Europeans, murdered them, while murdered long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in Southern.
I did not encounter that someone would deliberately silence the facts, but I heard earlier that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (especially in Japan there are atrocities from WW2 quite a taboo).
My point was rather that history was not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in some sensations, it's just what is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, when we are already with those Southern states, yes, confederation flag and famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they had some good success and came to me absurdly to put them down.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as it is currently idealizing enough people.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves and enough things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, deliberately leave some facts, lies and manipulate them, in addition, our perspective doesn't exist (it was also a video from TV where someone started talking about our legionarians and 1968).
What came to me at US schools funny was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never survived their land.
Overall, it came to me that at some universities it was scarce, those students were quite happy and those schools supported them once.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older once, I am a little evil of the fact that this could be the voice of most of them because they are among young people and in the ruler elite.
It comes to me that, for example, feminism has long achieved what he had and it is not about the same, he has been treated.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on the other hand, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical is someone, the more to hear it.
Anyway at the end, I also did not meet that someone would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I've met a bad geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's absolutely unprecedented.
Should I be proud of something I could not alone?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something with people takes me such interests, views of the world and common experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not faithful, but of what I know, I can say this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes there, one is Ukraine and the other Slovakia.
The Slovak farmer is a terrible faithful guy, has a doubt rather about theology than about politics, but then always a coconut about the coronavirus that everyone is stuck.
Then there is of course the Church of Czechoslovak Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to the services of the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but members are mostly liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functional temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominican Square and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do the mess in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Betlem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Breclav – The flame bent in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts were not in Vienna due to the pandemic of the coronavirus, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing of Reintal – Breclav.
Last year they took it on the border.
The Bethlehemian light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate annually with the section, I look forward to it.
It is the honour for me that I was chosen, told the present journalists of the scout Amalia Budiková.
While last year the transfer took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Breclav at the parking lot.
Usually for him, the scouts ride by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes to the delivery of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the betlemic light, the scouts traditionally trained to Brno, where they passed it to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlém.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel by selected quick and personal trains.
They will take light in the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame to the Czech Republic and where the rails do not know.
Even this year, scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It happens like last year.
We recommend both courier teams and organizers of local events to, of course, carry the knights, try to follow the steps, it was as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, she described the spokesperson for the betlemic light event Zuzana Hrbkova.
The betlemic light tradition, which travels to Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread at the same time with the flame of the idea of room, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehemian light is for believers a symbol of hope, the light that exceeds darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been taking care of in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is worth hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of ignorance and human mutuality.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the foundations of the economy that confirm that subsidies to cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education makes proper use of the money, and I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned - the unnecessary product is produced and it gains the free market and “natural life of the company”.
I am working in a factory where million signs are “xy financed/co-financed by the xi project” on the hallway, and such a company is simply artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs x people, this is the earlier development when this company holds and takes off contracts/employees to companies that could grow up and be more productive after its disappearance
Complete consent, it is terrible.
Sometimes even the person who was born at the Internet time is also caught into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet advertising with me is neglected, but then I'm just likewise catching out that I've been affected by it - it's just so so smashed that a person will not always defend it.
For this reason, I support radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to completely prohibit programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all the leadership, words classic - I would prohibit the Internet.
I feel of this faith has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believes and makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'm more happy to believe anything that is less likely, does not give it too much meaning, but it's important that I'll have my own original opinion about which I'll claim it's a critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything they say to the media"
3. "non-believable policy"
TVs missed the trend of Christmas films, their premiere are two hundred this year
Los Angeles – Cinema, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen down the trend of Christmas films and this year their audiences will present a record of more than two hundred.
It consisted of the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years in the public points out and significantly increases tracking, so these images are increasingly created.
This year, four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have Christmas (Vacation) in their name, so really there will be much more festive films.
Films that people traditionally connect with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales with this period, worldwide images of the Sami at home, Love of Heaven or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful since 1946.
But the right boom of Christmas images started until 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special film series, he reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Counting to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to fit its viewers at Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Competitive Lifetime station has 35 new Christmas films this year and a total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story is not so important, it is important that there are plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that snows," said Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be at home on Christmas movies).
“For the audience, this is the form of leakage and the way to feel a little calm in the middle of all the festive madness and madness of the world in which we have lived in the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that will be solved successfully and the two will kiss.
This is still around, and as long as all movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, complement Gray.

In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th section, which he qualified.
However, Rus Nikita Mazepin from the stable Haas finally does not interfere with the Great Abu Zabi prize.
It was positively tested for covid-19.
On the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last partition of Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who in the direct battle will meet Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is, according to the stable Gaas statement, quite well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with security being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," said her representatives for formula1.com.
The Gaas replacement rider will not send, nor can he send.
An alternative would have to complete a qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
With covid-19, the first racer is not affected.
At the start of the final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year he was positively tested by Sergio Perez No. Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
He is a little like portable jewelry and the creator puts in him half a year of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home the sweaters never carried too much," says Lebanon, who spent over his work 3000 hours over half a year.
Silkly bought in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has another hook.
"I'm completely on the other hand, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," says Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, was “only” CZK 720 000.

She added that it is two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adam School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adam.
Three of them have, according to the Director, slight symptoms, four unsymptoms.
Nobody suspected of Omikron travelling abroad
None of these traveled abroad, nor none of their families, nor contacted anyone who would stay abroad.
The relationship with the waterfield championship is not in any of the above mentioned, said Cyupek.
The main hygiene Pavla Svrčínová previously stated that an international tournament in the water field was checked in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player after returning.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to proceed as Texas when you ban abortions.
On Saturday, Guverner California Havin News announced the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous US state through the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of embryo heart rate.
People should then be entitled to compensation in the action of anyone who produces or sells attack guns and firearms in California.
Newsoma reacted to the Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texai ban on abortions in force, to be against almost 50 years of an old precedent verdict, which provided for the right to abortion on a surface throughout the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the prohibition was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack its usual trip.
“I am encouraged by the Supreme Court of the United States (February) decision yesterday, which allowed the preservation of the Texa ban of most food services and to a large extent supported the manoeuvre of Texas to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
“If the states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” News continues.
He, in collaboration with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice, mandated him to work on measures that would justify the public representative to enforce the prohibition of attacking guns and so-called weapons of spirit.
This is marked by a weapon that does not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
News wants to have “private citizens” the right to require compensation of at least $100,000 (over CZK 200,000) and court excuses from anyone who would virabel, distribute or sell attack guns, components of “arms of spirits” or sets for their production in California.
“If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons outside our streets, creating a threat to private actions, then we should do so exactly,” said the California Governor.
The AP Agency believes that California has forbidden the production and sale of some weapons of army style for decades, but in June the Federal Judge blocked the ban as constitutional.
The words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in the disagreement with the opinion on the Friday majority verdict, warned before the enlargement of that legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed if the state actually renewed by the Texas template.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognize full immunity against the judicial review and allowed food clinics to continue complaints against selected US officials.
Each emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to how the vaccination scheme will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already in a large roll.
And according to these studies, up to five times increases in antibodies in most patients, which has already mentioned long-term effect.
Just like every other vaccination will have its vaccination scheme for time, only soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should not enter the market, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.
Quantity learns to leave calmly.
But revalue what learns.
Since the time of Maria Terezie, our civilization and technology has advanced a little, and teaching telephone lists and descriptions of textbooks in the workbooks no longer makes sense and is the fact of losing time.
In these things, it would be brutal to remove.
On the other hand, how many people go from the base with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that will need to be needed for life?
How can I legally watch the online Championship League?
Do you not know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Championship League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and pay the Telly Sports Package for the Spanish and English Football League.
It does not include the UEFA League of Masters.
I think O2 offers the League of Masters, but I do not want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would act in contravention of law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, would stop the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already suspended the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the Union fund to restore the economies affected by covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the principles of the law.
“Poland should respond to this EU vision in all matters requiring unanimity,” said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarity Poland, without whose vote the current government would come closely to the majority of the Seyma.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policies that lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be just because the EU unlawfully rejects us from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister.
His party's approach to the EU takes more radical attitudes than the ruler's Party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes in Polish justice for Ziobr's action threaten its independence and undermine politicians.
According to Zibrá, Brussels states "impossible conditions because its goal is not a state of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces “the political dictatorship carried out by visions and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of a EU based on a partnership between sovereign states and not on the governments of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions of Brussels, which would result in a limited sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree to have Poland's status as colony,” he said.
But to recognize in this... We have one kind of cheese in four different places in Lila.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt met too many times, I needed only cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I cut off and asked.
They had him, it is true, in that narrow sector all were selected, less common and special cheese, but it was between vegetables and non-lactose zones...
If cursed, I don't even do any market, actions don't do anything, gold the edges on the square, there need not have such a choice, but most have everything I need and has some advice, so I have a ten-minute finished.
To Lila to take a vacation.
And it's all about me.
Two years I follow how data is treated here as a fertilizer, most vaccination resistors are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccinations.
Although rational discussions at the professional level take place, only extreme views are reached in the public space.
Continuously from the wall to the wall.
Binary consideration: vaccination saves us, vaccination is nothing.
Everything is prohibited, everything is allowed.
Color cakes instead of robust analyses.
Compare apples with pears.
This state has this and we have that.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states no one solves.
Oh, so I relieved.
Sorry for a fork and I wish you a nice day to all.
My childhood was punished by hobbies.
It was never because of stamps, most were just that I refused to hear and mislead (read instead of going to sleep, came with the bags, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I do it once again, I will get the wound (sometimes even after another "start" hob only brought and laid it so that I can see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable implementation and measure) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
It is important, according to me, that part of the warning because it gives the child its way to choose whether he will not hear and get, or will improve and the punishment will not.
Finally, I had only a warning to hear.
Selected system
When the important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtach Cepl answered the journalistic question, what the Czech Constitution meant for him – whether the sacred list, which she swears about, and which she reluctantly learned at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely adhered to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and to better save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
As the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he voted the question of Vojtach Cepl.
However, recently, there is increasingly an opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to change.
Summer is tested by situations that her creators (which Vojtach Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, the Ceple had the truth.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be a key to tackling most of the crisis that companies meet across the history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a number of government regulations consisting of individual rules laying down the politicians of mantinels of the game.
We are afraid that much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno I fight for the life of a monthly baby
Despite the fact that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases with which the hospitals are faced mainly recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected by less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, Primary Clinic of Children’s Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, Faculty of Medicine and Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children's patients who are severe with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need slight support care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Indeed, very severe children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were at the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"There is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means lung inflammation, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease interferes in addition to adults, both adolescents and several months' baby.
In hospitals, children are also in difficult condition due to coronavirus.
"Now we have a child of several months of adolescent age," said the primarily.
However, it is pleasant that no child deaths have yet been recorded at the children's hospital of FN Brno.
According to available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only at the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the collaboration of the psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“We recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone you can walk only on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not so large.
You can see on map.
Generally in national parks outside the peaceful zone you can walk anywhere (but not through the fence to the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked path must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so looking outside national parks).
How does the conductor exercise?
Music goes in my head, laughing Josef Kurfirt.
He played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing almost all the repertoire and act as conductor not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, at Josef Kajetan Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with Hradec Philharmonic, film phillharmonic or sub-Christmas symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of controlled infections and that authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Synologist Jiříš: China is building the impression of controlled infections and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China went to medical and political offenses.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected the criticism that he did not manage to stop the infection that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the earth says a zero increase of the infected.
States, including the Czech opponents on Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors, have helped many in combating coronavirus, for example, at the top of Italy.
How to perceive the hunting of Beijing?
Is it a friendly support or a communist regime is trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and tells him: gel don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The husband is happy because the salvation of grass, the car washs with a boot, the children play with him.
But a simple parade.
If you want to sell the elephant for 5000.
Camera: so yeah, yeah, it's gonna be a parade...
After some time they meet and what he bought complains: what are the will you sold for elephants????
The lawn breaks, everywhere the giant branch, the car settled, the children are afraid of him, and the wife wants to let him divorce.
Those who have sold said, Immortally speak of the elephant, you don't sell this elephant...
World events are controlled by high powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only happen if it works to integrate it.
So far, it works at the level of economic and political (in selected questions), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think Europe is directing towards federalisation.
It will not be 10, 15 or 20 years old.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, moods will be different and this will be done.
It also ignored me and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so maybe a Slovakian.
Only I am based on the fact that ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruits and mandarins” are no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I am based on the fact that the sentence sounds “all American forces”, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad term and it is not necessary to further specify for the US forces.
But again, you need only words :D
Whether it's so, or so, it's an unsensual requirement
A five-degree earthquake was recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's Tokyo metropolis and the surrounding areas hit 5.0 degrees of earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said that buildings had been hungry in the capital, but no damage had yet been reported.
No warning was issued or warned before the tsunami, Reuters informed.
Vicky Holland from Britain tortured the cap of cosman Milly
The decisive photographs show the moment when the sweetened monkey was crying in the toilet mission before her sensitive owner was flushing and hanging her.
Dutch monkey also feededed parks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate court in Gwent now banned her lively animal breeding, informed The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of opices who care for Milly after her tyranny declared that such an excited space had never seen.
Milly spent nearly two years of rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset and now plays again with another saving monkey name Moon.
Four times the mother was admitted to two accused of unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrate court in Gwent, she was imposed a twelve-year sentence of imprisonment with a suspended delay for one year.
Dutch was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-life ban on animal breeding and must pay at a cost of CZK 12,000.
Steph Sawier's leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the tyranny animal, said, "Milly is okay, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milli lasted before she was accustomed to people.
She cried and hid himself in front of everyone who met and any loud sound or sudden movement he shouted her.
She refused to eat her for a long time.
Even now, when she settled and satisfied with a male, her view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from tyranny will be accompanied forever, Sawier adds.
Tyranny Milly appeared after the police in Hwent discovered a horrible shot in a woman's phone after a shock in her apartment due to drug charges.
On the shots you can hear how Milly gives vulgar.
On another video it is to hear how Holland's monkey offers a cocaine and says, "Do you want a cocaine?"
So I'll get my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russel Cox (43) admitted to holding a cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (at least 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from this revision three times after you staticly cross the entire 20th century?
How do you take the same things as in the sixth class?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, honour excludes, won't know if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test on 1 and then it does not interest anyone.
Running and on the street random people ask if you can determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone has gone through, and the absolute majority will not scratch and tell you that they have absolutely in their teaching.
So what does it learn about?
I am a great fund of a general overview and the fact is that people don't want and have no need.
And at that moment it's unnecessary and you'll never get it equally to them.
This is partly learned for a lot of people who will need this thing.
But like, the note that on the walls of the machine you don't need it all, I thought absolutely seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we get slowly until you know the stamp of the punch.
(What is probably our communist past and juice against students and elites) However, the price of barbara becomes just high for us in those machines.
If the journalists were able to count, they probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first glance: War of Kadri and Andrei continues!
What is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied to the instagram in Stories to all questions of raising fans, what she disappointed on Kadri so that she decided to terminate all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrei, it has been violined since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, i.e. at least until he returned to Bohemia.
But she refused to do so.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only ended with love, but rather grew into mutual respect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he started turning Kadra in response to Andreino's charges of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri now has not liked his younger sister Linde.
She decided to detain her brother publicly.
Normally, these things are not expressed at all and we never said too much extra in the family.
I don't want to definitely cause some regret.
But when I see someone trying to hurt publicly and dirty the name of someone I like so much, it just doesn't give me!
I am sorry that I have to do this, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri for having done his own character and helping our family when we needed it even the youngest age.
It's more fraudulent to me when I have to read such false information that is probably quite disappeared from the context.
I would all like to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and the family, is in recognition in response to the words of Andrei.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him all over and know the reality and know how it was actually added uncertainly.
The drunken thief was flooded on the facade on the fifth floor.
You don't believe what.
Cchao started his ski trip at the parking lot in the residential neighbourhood, where he tried to enter several cars.
According to the available information, the vehicle finally departed at least 330 crowns.
Then he thought nothing better than climbing on the 5th floor and climbing the open window into the apartment.
There were two bananas stolen.
On the shot from one security camera, it is then captured how to leave the street away from the place of action and at the same time rides the banana.
When the owner of the apartment wake up in the morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Then Cchaaa detained.
A man admitted that on an incriminated day he drank something alcohol.
And because he needed money, he decided to lie in despair.
The whole thing is still in the investigation.
The pineapple wrapped up on the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and the effectiveness is linked to pandemic emergency.
When you are cancelled, the law will not be effective.
While the law limits the scope of business
That's not enough for you?
The right to assembly will be limited, but not cancelled.
More than 60 percent of the voters came to four municipalities’ representatives on Saturday elections
New representatives of people on Saturday elected in Komna villages in Hungary, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and in Rovno in Pelgrimovsko.

A total of 28 mandates were 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday elections for us symbolicly closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to general representatives took place in it, and primarily very observed elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpova, Vice-President of the CSU.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding for equipment and staff security.
In Komna in Hungary, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, which received 27.76 per cent of votes and two mandates in the seven-member representativeship.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of votes, which also means the profit of two mandates.

Once again, the mayor of the village of Jana Křižková, who is a member of Private people, was also represented by the representative office.
One mandate was reached by the Commission – independent candidates.
Urnas accounted for 75.48 per cent of legitimate voters.
In the village of Rovna in Pelhřimov, the Association Pro Rovni won.
It gained 50.50 per cent of votes, which means four of the seven mandates.

Electoral participation was 42.9 per cent of voters.
On Monday, the results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilist or foreign politician?
I think this is all that people write here you know well.
Just play on the fool to be with whom to "think".
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or nothing such.
Even I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which eventually was the goal to look good).
And I'm quite one who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am defective in how much church had too much money in the Middle Ages, how much money was recorded, suppressed science, etc.
Don't talk about all wars that caused, for example, the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetto monster, but the state and church do not have anything to do together
The man fell down from twelve metres.
Now the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, with rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service.
Employees of the Regional Operational Centre took an hour after Saturday midnight emergency call with the first information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two crews of ZZS - medical and medical.
After arrival in the place of healthcare, they found that a seventeen-year-old man had to fall from the window from about twelve meters high and impact his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice the coal caught.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went to the event.
At the time of arrival of rescue services teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to life.
The intervening doctor invented his breathing path, provided artificial lung ventilation and, after further measures in the framework of pre-National urgent care, transported him a sanitary vehicle to the next care of the Ostrava Traumatological Centre, informed the spokesperson for the MSZ of the Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns than coronavirus from inadequate public and government responses
The broadening of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a call for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against infection is primarily physicians and medical personnel.
How important is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Rezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things are divided.
Julianna Penová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amandu Nunes, who did not find a winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, showed great scratches against Dustinu Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kay Kara-France, who quickly destroyed Cody Harbrandt by the technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one waited.
This brought women's bantama scales between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Pen.
The Americans entered the mutual battle as a thoughtful “throat”, for Nunes did not lose seven years and grinded her teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path behind the victory a lot actively and the opponent even sent push kick to the ground.
However, foam was not forced to have any other mistake, and she tried to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was cutting and for MMA fans very tensile.
Both opponents participated in a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got on the ground, where she began to cut her.
She had to try to give up and attack off.
The Americans thus prepared a huge shock when he became a new champion.
The top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was better managed, but the card began to turn.
In that second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to overcome the levers on his hand.
He didn't manage too much, but then he created great pressure, got the opponent on his back and hit him a number of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked hockey, to which Poirier had been resisting for a while, but then he had to scatter.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, for two years.
In the next match, he wrote a sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already settled on Raulian Paiv in the first round hard right back.
He then won a number of precisely measured strikes and recorded fifteen triumphs.
Kara-France then managed to consult Cody Harbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now she lost for seven years.
Did he dig or dig you?
At first glance, nothing is difficult.
Most of the substantial names in Czech are expressed only by one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem with them to determine whether it is a male, female or medium family.
Then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantial names in which the family is not fixed.
Such substantial names fluctuate between two families.
When inclining, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “sweesel” or “sweesel” are both male and female, in the first place they inclined according to the model “sweeper”, in the second according to the model “songs”.
For other groups of substantive names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, for example: row/row, cylinder/club or cylinder/potatoes (in the sense of food).
Both faces are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely substitutable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian version is unwritten, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "cumber" and "cumber", "cumber" and "cumber" etc.
Some words that penetrated Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually accept Czech endings.
A typical example is the word “image”, which is a male and female family, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle family inclined, but has endings according to the pattern “hall”.
Turkey opened a journey for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look right on the Greek borders?
The Greek-Turkish border has tensions due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to reach Europe further.
Thousands of people began publishing to the southern border of Schengen after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, and the Czech Government is also undertaking humanitarian assistance.
What actually motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what does the situation look right on the spot?
Three months we didn't see blue heaven and we thought, a journalist from Sydney describes
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and disappeared millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with disasters?
Can the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent drastic impacts, how hard critics?
And what countries will need to prepare for the future for climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalists from Sydney Iki Detřich.
False accusations were always and are quite rare.
Therefore, everyone is always written completely everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to solve both sexual violence in our society and both terrible expansion and try to order it.
I don't know personally anyone who was falsely charged.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and experienced how people often behave about their surroundings or police.
Victims should always believe.
The trend was that victims finally open up their trauma.
But it still leaves too much people for themselves.
Yes, even those who falsely accuse someone will find.
It is a angry and facial victim of sexual violence, but by disseminating the idea that "a large part of the accusations is thought" and that it is "trend" you only help sexual violence.
Czech Republic floods flooded houses, families do not have money to finish
Prices of construction material increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have reached the wedding situation.
There is no means to complete disposed of households and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already disposed of family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to disassembled and uncollaborated houses.
In the worse case, uninhabited houses are uninhabited, and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgage and to pay for it even rental," says economist Štěpán Kreček.
We will build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even if the material irritated.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivon.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the building of the house to go for five million, now it will become seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
The material was most affected by honey, iron, as well as installation and topping equipment.
However, construction companies also fight labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of structural fields and the influx of foreign workers brake the pandemic.
At this moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of construction permits is beneficial.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're going to be good and we'll be still better.
But actual vision is missing, says ČRO commentator – mujRozglas
In addition to classical celebrations, politicians have traditionally accompanied joining the new year.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of YES Andrej Babiš and the Christmas Message of President Miloš Zeman and the President of the Senate and the House of Deputies spoke to the people.
What is essential?
As in this, my diploma comes super right, I have my own theme I have chosen, follow the bachelor, I always do it all year round, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The villages are completely quiet, if a person is not a total poppy and something remains in his head, so he will not unnecessarily throw him on the theory.
I must have learned a week at the state station and when I was at the end, so my commission always tried to bring to some logical derivation that I was accompanied and I had the right thing.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to make them the semester project (we have done it a lot of times, really beneficial, a lot of learning) and then only learn the project and have to be obsolete.
According to me, it is super when at the end of the course there is an examination to which knowledge obtained within the project is demonstrated, not only defence.
But do not absorb any e-mails and phones and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same lens as they.
Those people in the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they might have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But quietly, next to the statue of the bear Pu put a similar statue of Putin.
You still need to put it in such a way that Xi Inping's ass or so.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under his feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, you will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function if the layer, comment or saved.
It's horrible to me recently succeed, so I may have to reduce to a tiktoke where a lot of artists from my branch have success and don't allow to do so.
Finally, I might also like to come something user-friendly, what does not scare from artists all creativity and energy
Statement by Donbas Workers
The union – yes, broken – no, express their opinion on the image by the opponents of the breakdown of the USSR.
Thirty years since the unlawful breakdown of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster took place in the history of humanity.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Elcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open conciliating attitude of Michael S. Horbach, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “The Union of the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality stops existing”.
One thing of the feathers "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the disintegration of the USSR, dozens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were found abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Even before, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one seat in the Belovéžské forest betrayed the socialist camp (creating the prize of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, contaminated agriculture, rejected the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked to a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, army, the growth of criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of a geopolitical chapter, the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been destroyed and devoted to ruin was quickly filled in and conquered by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical chapter.
And the whole world is so far cut mainly due to events from the end of the eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket worth 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with I put it in the refrigerator and make it on Thursday evening.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy meat on Monday, it will be discounted to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - will you describe my mechanism, which of this meat will change its price to be an attraction for my digestive system?
And or wait to quarter and this meat will be discounted 1 day before the consumption date to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK on the road and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I will send myself - nothing.
These are the things that when something is cheap, so it must be guaranteed bad, disproportionate or unquality you are terriblely retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I recently went to Heads in Brno and in the approach of dairy distributed some brochure, like things I always take to help brigades, they can't get it...
Well, the brochure was full of rural intelligence and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I found it to be a kind of agitation.
After reading, I found who issued it and finally came out of it scientology.
Well, like a good mattress, full of completely unnecessary picks, as I have to be taught and not learned.
A bad paper, because of this, the forests would not have to go.
I experienced something similar to the former girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional visualism force you to comply with this person because you like it without realizing how much it is in the p*deli situation.
Sometimes I was threatened with hurt because of this I went with a friend who was not happy to move out.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, I was asked to go on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year, it was a super relationship, but then it took another half a year and started to crash it on the stick.
Then I ended my relationship with it, and I told her to break out, but I can talk about it next week to calm it, and not to catch some amoke.
Such a person hangs your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
More preferably hold the distance
When the insurance companies are scratched by purchasing the cloud of tests and going to positive ones who would not be a test or know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of domestic imprisonment.
In the west they ceased with the chashkers and recognised that they had no price to solve the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something else and drive its thoughtful busting.
I'm looking back to the old good scar.
After several years of refusal and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment returns to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (which was 20 years old, the element at the university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "that may not be interested, especially people's seizure".
I was sincerely interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were rather about how to scare and leak people.
When the first earned money came, man quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he must navigate several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgage were the only earnings, or then a man felt as a ground seller of pots.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump right on every top and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't all go into one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumer goods or "fat" content.
In the corporate where I did not experience much such things.
HR is quiet, managers look at their management and they don’t squeeze us much into anything.
Regular evaluation is now somehow happening in the form of what is happening to us quite (see some goals for the next year, we look at what happened in a year and what is not) - it is rather self-evaluation than evaluating someone according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also not required.
But we are a little escaped in our company - they are separated from what are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels that we are a short startup that scoots in the offices of a large corporate no.
But this works so I don't poison us much until the results are.
The Czech is missing in Britain after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days the British police searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech who lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced James Kulhánek's demiss on social networks that women from Hungary were found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police today afternoon confirmed to our representative office in London that she found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not communicate more information to the case.
Honest sister, said on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman last seen on November 28 in the bus when traveling from work, before attending, she was still to pick up money from the ATM.
Her disappearances were announced by colleagues five days later.
After that, the London police began to search, Interpol included her among the missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this context have arrested one man a few days ago.
What role he had to play in the case and what he suspected of, but did not publish.
In four municipalities, new representatives were allocated by the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, in the villages of Komna in Hungary, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovna in Pelgrimovsko elected a new representative office.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
There were 99 candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
Electoral participation reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovna, where 93.62 % of the voters were elected.
A total of 8 women and 20 men gained the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for new elections to representatives in the four municipalities.
There were 28 representatives of 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidacy was 46.6 years old.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday elections for us symbolicly closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to general representatives and, above all, very observed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in the more challenging epidemic conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpova, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistics Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and post-approval will be published in the Laws Collection.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a totally dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning of the moment, but it went without more irritation.
To cope with how much of the population on all their layers becomes idiotic, I have a problem so far.
I am most looking forward to vaccination ( tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally depend on the fact that other people are not beaten.
He would be deprived of the presidency and the ability to recruit it.
The chance that this really happens is, but as others mention a lot small here.
Moreover, I am not sure if the writing of the writing would at all be considered a railroad.
The Iron Council is an act that threatens the President of the Republic to sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased number of people under 35 years old who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the USA live their lives without sex.
It is mainly religiously based people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who appear to have raised from eight to 21 per cent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age, who said they had no sexual intercourse in the last year, is more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the research of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less prioritized for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35, who state that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS Liman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been sex-free in the past year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of pre-marriage and religious foundation is also contributed to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and committed under 35 years of age is still declining.
Young people divide the view on pre-marriage sex, about 30% of it has a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that there are minorities among free individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts this trend," says Stone about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage relations, the reason for religious foundation is.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60% for free people under 35 years of age, who participate in religious meetings more than once a month.
Between "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interactions and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason can be the expansion of digital media that apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replace” this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The entire vaccination against covid is whether society should force part of the population to behave, which they do not want, but which can save them life.
It is a relatively difficult question on which my personally most interested question of social conscience.
For example, the question whether if we do not rule them and they will die, it will be our wines.
My argument is that we could definitely die for the death of an eighty-year-old man who actually did not know much, we did not explain it well to him, heard some disinformation, and, as a result, did not vaccinate and eventually caught and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a confirmed vaccination vaccination resistance, which, on the side of the SPD and the CNR, takes something about the chic and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly imported that most of the unavailable pensioners are most likely to be part of the second group, so they will really be able to do so.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter sign up to fight dry?
This summer winter has yet to bring one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic recently.
The ski area operators do not worry without technical snow, the weather complicates for example the preparation of ski resorts Jizera fiftieth.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight dry in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a panbichker in her.
Once on the middle of us, the teacher led across the whole city on the boat so that we could go on the boats along the river.
We went there once such a very wide street and whom we probably do not see in the middle - accomplices of the sect Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Of course, they met at us.
I fortunately fled, but with one friend they went into speech.
When she left them, we asked her with her teacher what she said to them.
"I asked if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul," she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the boat.
We are terriblely blurred.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system is already grit, says Orozović
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We open a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is appreciated to solve using diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Norman Group”, associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because at night we record hundreds of attempts (illegal) to cross borders.
The Chancellor discussed other sanctions to finally understand Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko's regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish regolnica blamed the accident, she tried to secret it
The car returned to the place of an accident for a while, but the car controlled another eptic that tried to take guilt on itself.
When police officers told her that it could not be preferred to drive and accidentally arrive at the driving licence, she went out with the truth, she said TVN24.
She acknowledged that another petitioner had arrived in the vehicle, who asked her for help.
Policies then came for the sister Celestine.
The breathing tests were also undergone, and after they found that they had over two passes in the blood, they immediately removed the driving licence.
At the same time, they announced that they would report to the court.
Dog Gugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmović, however, did not care for his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at in American priests about dogs of lovers.
However, they forgot a substantial thing: the legitimacy of the film craft.
After the coach film F. Brabce Hump - a dog who taught people to live, we are looking for another picture here.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows my previous film Here I watch here from 2012.
On the scene, the speaking songwriter Hugo returns and some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the Shumav Pension, who is scoming, will begin to invite the dog, Juliin the father with a partner and mainly her daughter Veronika.
It is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who lives the first love.
The director with the partner Beatriz Shajmović (which is also the producers of the film) faced the procedures described in the previous dog's image, but at least children and dogs enjoyed it.
This time she wrote a creative pair of even weaker scenarios that causes a mixture of amazingness and feelings of patience.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although the scientists, is in the desire for a child with dark wiseness and if the right “constellation” comes, cooperates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), served Colonel Mojmir despite the flying training of shots in the forest his own daughter (Julia), who falls into the comate, whereby the family is taken away by the hospital so that in the heart of the Shumav lonely can play a miraculous process of healing the dog.
Nothing against cleaning treatment of nature and the strength of animal soaps.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer appreciates what content he had filled with unprecedented situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thiefs from the staff, the competition of pejskars, the Shumavski šarlatan, the police coming to search for "roads" and discussing herbs about the fertile strength of bone balls – and which the family in the pension is of course opposite.
When the hero takes care of the heavy commodity and sits naondulated and poured with a cigar at the family table and requires father whisky and flacotta as cured vegetarian, it cannot be confused.
On top of this, the audience’s creators explained that “this is sometimes happening after the comate”.
Shajmovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgic knowledge of working with text, the ability to exhibit bearing situations, feel for characters and point characters and directorate.
Actress performances are unbalanced, the cut is irreparable and the overall impression of excitement.
Whether Lukáš Váculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand up their party, they don’t have too much to play.
The only layer of the film remains the poetic shots of the Shumav nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of filmmakers.
It is not enough to depict a few characters, chambers and dogs of glashes, as well as more folk vulgar expressions that the characters are allowed.
You are not even flying membership in the Club of breeder breeder - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship of man with a dog, the knowledge of the craft must also be if a person wants to tell a faithful story.
This did not happen in this case.
On a good family picture there is a little bit of erotic and a minimum feeling for the genre.
Not even as an advertisement on canisterapia, this amateur conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant supplements exactly from flaws like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcedness, here you can see them how you understand it, but this is just because you have never experienced it.
The decision is always on the customer if he does not want, the answer will always be not.
If you listened to the furt, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like everyone else, in which it's a brigade of ghosts.
The nearest east is an unusual dry month.
Winter is the only period in the year when it rains.
“This complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, Kfar Giladi village in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average in November.
Rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It didn't happen for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas balloon, rejoiced by the inhabitants of Nazareth Wassim Ashkar.
Cloudy in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, they are shocky and irregular.
On winter rains are dependent forests.
Without them they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supply and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water farmers have warned before dry for a long time.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall can be killed here,” said Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as wastewater disposal or recycling.
Mountains are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tank cars arrive.
The waters and private wells dry.
“Summer orders rose from seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imad Sulejman said in September.
In Iran, Isfahan disappeared clashes between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protest was dry.
The root of the local river felt completely without water.
The region has the dryest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing military intervention against Iran
The Israeli Minister of Defence stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lys informed.
Gantz, who lives in the USA, is trying to convince the Americans of their pressure on Iran, but also informs Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference at Florida Gantz, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world's power "it understands that the Iranians play with them".
About 3 years ago this happened too.
I fell a bit and grilled at the interview to find out what I wanted to do after me.
Finally, I found my suspicion of pyramid was legitimate.
Because I really don't like these subfusions, so I am a daughter of doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
Quietly tell me that I'm dirty, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains for a weekend, waiting for enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first larger emphasis of skiers this weekend.
After a significant snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snowfall and some skiers started operation.
The skiers did not dismiss the obligation to demonstrate a certificate of covideo for lifts.
While the lifters do not complain about customers’ inconvenience, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country trails and pistes.
The skiers laund the weather that offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, this starting weekend has actually gone since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," he praised the interest of the director of the Sports Facility Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, they had a Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Bránn in Šumpersk.
Weekend visit was very decent, estimated at 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are accompanied.
Today the sun lighted, there were about three degrees, so the perfect one did not save praise by the representative of the ski resort in Bránna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after the disease covid-19.
Until the exceptions are people ready for this and demonstrate the necessary documents, ČTK Rene Groneš said from the Ski Center Špindlerův Mlín.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before pandemic voices some rental and sales ski equipment.
Fortunately, interest in ski rental is.
It is not like in recent years, but still customers are enough, said Alexander Bokišov from the Skyopava shop in Opav.
Greater emphasis is expected during the period of ski courses.
The leader of the Royal Hradecian company Snowbear David Šintak feels that due to covid, there is no interest in renting ski equipment such as before.
These times before the pandemic we have been almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said Šintak.
People, according to him, were destroyed with pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand records the rental in the Nováky area in God's Dar.
The ski rental started there a week ago and interested people must now order them in advance.
“We start leasing cross-country tickets this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect great interest as well as last year,” said the operator of the Pavlina Novakova area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also noted in the ski school.
If we want successful and rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to find a dentist or a doctor of a specialist.
Abroad leaves smart and chic people who have no property here.
The owner of the company abroad does not only go so.
But with the rest, absolutely consent.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not just live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban on one beautiful day, reigning the year and at the same time raising the annual emigration by a few tens of thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic from day to day cannot feel in a similar position.
Another question is the choice at all.
When there is a foolish life, there can also win a traditional V4 maid.
Youth and education will leave, remain its supporters and people whose property cannot be cut into the aircraft.
Desive photo!
Langmajer in blood due to betting about beer?
While in the Czech Republic was full of autumn, in Thailand, the headquarters of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor published a bloody photo of the face on social networks.
Is it just injury, or is it a drawing for shooting?
The London police are still looking for an unknown Czech.
The last time was seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior and we begin to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where she worked.
“Their family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns and in short wants to know where they are,” she continued.
According to her on Sunday 28 November, about 19:45 she left her work and headed home to Camberwell district.
The last time was reportedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by some of their colleagues.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a "Healthcare Assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
“We have extreme concerns about our expensive colleague Petr, who is unknown,” said a group of medical facilities in the twitter contribution.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find it to contact the police,” the communication continued.
Ambassador Harriet Harman also invited the public to collaborate on Saturday on the case of Srnc during the press conference.
"It's not known for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understood to be obsolete," said Labourist politician, holding photos of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have special responsibility to try to find it, because it was outside of my home country, away from the family and worked here for our health care," said Harmanová.
The police had previously detained one man who remained in prison.
According to the BBC intelligence website, however, the police did not provide any information about the identity or the identity of the man.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTH (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't even appreciate Ukraine.
This is not a "multiple quantity", but about 8 per cent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that the threat of Invasion increases and begins to have our input full of teeth.
I felt at the top.
I don't know what he found Russia wants to war.
The war is an expensive legacy and Russia has a GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is outside the points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this already with the First Punish War and the "anexis" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not comply with agreements from Minsk, Russia announces the funny republics.
This is all and this would be the "concentration" on the borders so matched.
Yeah, pacta sunt servanda...
New schedules are valid in Prague since Sunday, touch mainly suburban connections
Travelers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially in suburban connections.
There were new lines, some changed the route, and otherwise disappeared.
Mladoboleslavia is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday I stop fasting from České Budějovice in the Garden City station.
In the suburban train transport, trains S7 are going through the Prague Main Station on the route from Berin to Bohemian Brod.
In the newly operated station Prague-Zahradní Město will newly stop R17 from České Budějovice and Benešová.
PID is newly expanded to other areas.
Otherwise, buses will go to Svitlá nad Sazavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Old Splavs and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslav, including lines with crossing to Liberec and Králové Hradec Region.
When integrating, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will go from Prague Zlíčín to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague and Královíce near Rakovník, which replaces the cancellation of the S53 train line.
They will be reinforced in the morning of the top and on the weekend of connections from Prague to Rakovnik, when new express line number 404.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 to Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Strižkov, not from the station Nadraži Holešovice.
The 400-way line goes through Melnik, Duba and Czech Lipa to New Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 additional line goes through Melnik and Duba do Doks, Mimone and Jablonne in Podještěda.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of medieval local routes, including Mochov, Dobriš or Rožmital under Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Berin, Prague – Lisa nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on Line 420 from Dobriše, followed by Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevská.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nimburg were changed and the routes of some buses on the borders of Central Bohemia and Gorovice in the Pilsen Region are adjusted.
Healthy snack/ lunch in the supermarket office
Hey, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option where to find food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lila.
Since I have no movement, I have no power to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy as possible and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy maximum pizza jelly and to the snack yogurt and apples.
Question: What healthy without heat treatment would you recommend to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only the top of the tree can hide under the snow.
If the tree is destroyed, the tree can be more prone to mushroom disease.
I don't claim that this is the only reason why they prohibit us from riding outside the slopes, but it's one of them.
Recognition of the Gifts of Relationship with Nedved: I didn't find it at all
Czech show business pond from Friday than nothing else than revealing the relationship between Dari Rolins and Paul Nedved.
It has been pulling together since the summer, the famous footballer even let him divorce due to the singer.
The gift now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she secreted love for half a year before them.
“I am allowed to claim that there is no one currently in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would escape that Dara caught bear, now pardon, Nedveda,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to the ears.
But they packed her, not on the contrary.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to the public, they have no joy.
And it's here.
What we both didn't find, but we knew that the singer continues to do so once.
I just don't know who's on the mountains.
If those who are not interested in it at all and jump it on them and from the preserve, or we whose lives dive in detail.
As if someone of you would like to hear an opinion whether you fit with yourself with your husband or girlfriend, or you insisted that but really everyone knows the list of your former partners and are familiar with the reading of your mistakes and errors.
It's a stranger, you want it, Dare's defects.
She gave herself together in Italy, where Rolins rided due to the preparation of her new fashion collection.
He has long been the Vice-President of Juventus Football Club.
With the truth, he went now because they were waiting for the end of Nedved's divorce.
Ivana's wife has been distinguished for three years, but the papers are not their own but only three weeks.
In any event, to those who are happy with us and wish us this, thank you.
And we are only people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
Therefore, I love my new man, and I stand with him, and I close Rolins in good and evil.
Hello, the other commentators have probably said everything substantially, I just confirm that the colleagues are super at the beginning, my collaborators mostly familiar with during the first semester or two familiarized, and then found the societies together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Most apartments do not advertise too long in advance, so you probably do not find it too much now, but look at the offer will certainly not damage.
Otherwise, not only Cejl but also the surroundings (the streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), but some parts of Jewish are a little ghettos.
On the contrary, the district of Veveri is a lot of students, the Queen of Field and the direction is fine, in addition, it is close to most faculties of VUT (unsure where you are exactly coming).
I've never been hiring now, but I've been born Brnák, so I can consult Brno as if you still missed any information :)
But this is an example of a completely "normal" consideration.
Due to what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely okay that the state does not fund some schools sufficiently.
Whether they learn what they want and pay it from their own or whether they eat according to the state and pay it to the state.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control a piece of education only because a few crowns will be able to learn what he wants to make a full state contribution, and thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost on the weight when a person writes it, who two days earlier expressed such a petition for the fighter of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against that if someone goes to abortion is the same as the voice against any statue to stand on the square?
I would consult you directly with the person who asked you the job.
Otherwise, I already experienced cataloguing/digitalization that (and even long-term professionals) it either fits from the eye, or records something on the way xxx ***** or ... (according to the convention) and notes that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
I would personally deal with this in probably somehow in the note on which program you use.
If you would like to be a proper and trying student, you can look at some character databases and search for the closest one.
But because it looks like you draw from some book, I would like to advise that the author or printer simply created his own character that sits on what is physical on the coin.
PS: Isn't it accidental rather the Odessa Empire (Kingdom) than OdriNsk?
PSS: someone has already distinguished it here.
Make a look at the comment with Φ🇪G
Politicians do not even know what will be a "theme" of our Presidency.
This is much worse than that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood any text, is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined by the word from the word, to the same basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the case of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is suitable for informal contacts, superstandard relations.
Moreover, with those English it is quite interesting, after the performance of the GB from the EU.
I don't understand that gate on Cejl.
For the third year I have been working there and completely fine.
I'm going from work I at 10 evening and never a problem.
That is that ghetto can only tell someone who almost didn't work there in life.
Yeah, there were about most of the Romani populations in Brno, but only what they do is that they obstruct on the pedestrian and park where they don't have :D definitely it's not that I'd be afraid to climb there in the evening.
So if you are looking for a relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, so I would walk to it calmly.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built apartments.
Felix Slovak (78) without Uncle and the lover of Helem as a bike in the fence!
Who dies Christmas?
On Sunday, most people on the advent wreath burned the first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I have no advent wreath, so it was not what to ignore.
Uncle's wreath I saw and Lucie certainly also has someone, said Blesk saxophonist who confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but they were not in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The Slovakian still doesn't know where it's going to be for the Christmas evening.
Recently we met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček a Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
Gifts buy continuously and Dade and Lucia certainly buy something, probably a perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the cross of a music video clip to Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to meet, says the Slovakian who was glad to meet the wife of Ludka Sobota Adrian or singer Kamil Nivlt.
And they gave it a clear idea.
And we are Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be completely idiot so that this territory is not located.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, do you explain to me now?
I do not know any other ingredient that could be applied in hospitals in the crisis.
Police are small and cannot afford it, as well as firefighters, and nowhere else is the high percentage of healthy trained people at such level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava so akorat goes to the head of previous governments, not armies, ask you for new toys for quite a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry period in the last summer.
Water, according to scientists, killed in mountain and suburban areas, smaller rainfalls also record places where there has not yet been an emergency of moisture.
The causes of dryness in large part of Central Europe are climate change.
However, the impacts also strengthen the way we manage with soil.
What about dry preparation?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it will be so, I will still keep in ice skates, mushrooms I know what is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also the overall industry.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so play two goals even if you don't have to win them differently for each prize than when compared.
But as I listen to Czech commentators what they dream, whatever men's or women's ice hockey notice, it's all strange, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And if it was opposite as if it was always elsewhere, and that the Czech Republic with Russia more often lost than it won, probably it would be a classic "war lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of injuries in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily injuries.
Hospitalized is 5766 people.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, a further 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100,000 in the Czech Republic, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faced "inevitable" large wave infection caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on the TV Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Security Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with omicrone are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
Nobody died at the omicron yet, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after infection and died about three weeks after infection.
Keyr Starmer, head of British labyrists, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by organizing a Christmas quiz last December when lockdown was introduced and a Christmas party was banned at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government gave the quiz "virtually" through a computer.
However, they participated in the Downing Street Group of Employees collected around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous messaging despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are confident that Johnson and his government have done legacy:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Television Editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the cruel majority in general elections.
Today, the Conservative Party says that it is necessary to remove it from the premiere function.
Considerable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to rotate and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orban.
This will be the choice of European importance.
How much can you expect to be ferry?
They will not be ferry.
They will not probably be free, because they were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to gain from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last sounds so far that everyone can choose where he wants in practice.
This allows Fidesz to convert voters from district decisions to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that the fair will not be at all.
Do you think it will be the same nefer as in 2014 and 2018?
For the situation is significantly different.
It was first about whether Fidesz won, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a unified opposition.
This is a great unusual for Victor Orban and his side.
Will not try to keep much to play even harder?
Yes, we have some signs that you are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, she escaped to independent media a recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Laszloa Köver, where the heads of secret services interpret that the opposition is threatened to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, this is one of the news.
Everything begins with the language.
I was quite often, last in 14, my mother's parents do not have much patience, I'm also not, her dad has long, but then I would be extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was a lot cholerical and I fled like a little terrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in the shrimp and was entire blue, it was about 2 times taken under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I was screaming up, sometimes it was more likely that they no longer knew.
I am definitely also tended to solve things by violence, as little as I wanted, now for discharging at least something next, and as younger as I need parents, I cried through my hands for example (to get no power through the holder), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have this force.
I am not able to determine to what extent this is my explosiveness, but certainly my proportion also raises you.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve the same thing.
I think that to be children is simply bad and that my parents should not do it, especially at the moment when it was no longer “introductory,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply possesses something, probably it is not possible for my children not to eat at least a little, so I do not count it to them.
I don't miss it, I don't understand why OP should stand for something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
I would therefore call Kundami what laws create in such quality.
Otherwise, would I be interested in whether you are not afraid of income failures?
You can really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have what mortgage to pay from?

Where does Slovakia move the process with the enemies of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main lecture begins in the process of square appeals against the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kochner and his involvement in the top Slovak policy and justice.
How will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists can be behind this huge.
How is it possible that this petition has regularly more media attention than the anti-petition of the dean of all medical faculties, which came out by day, two later?
On the other hand, they were going to blame and the society was getting off.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal by Minister Karl Havliček needs to be substantially redrafted
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law, which should ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens when choosing and authorizing the deep storage of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Government after aviation prosthetics by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is seriously contrary not only to the communities concerned associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also to the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects a stronger strengthening of its possibilities in repository decision-making, which is promised by the Mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech atomic law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redraft the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform available, refers to the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of repository sites is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a general intention almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes citizens practically just a statistical figure in authorisation proceedings.
The design misses systemic compensation settings for municipalities for the whole process of searching and choosing a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities really have no excessive opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in searching for repositories.
Only in some authorisation proceedings may submit their comments or appeals, however, the Office or Minister decides to issue the authorisation.
The case does not have a delay in carrying out research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-government that the Platform calls for is the principle of common use in many democratic advanced countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in repository permits, as in Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, among other things, another failure of the state administration to hire an external legal office for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which concluded SURAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemank.
The total amount for these works is to be almost CZK 4 million according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the vice-chairman of the village Cejle from Hradek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry who streamlined the position of self-government against government authorities in search of depth storage of highly radioactive wastes only sent to their successors, we are waiting for a stronger turnover from the new government.
We also offer an auxiliary hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which considers the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such a fundamental building as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's access to burned nuclear fuel management and other radioactive wastes that will not be limited to depth storage only.
The Platform further encourages the decision to select a location for any storage to be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear to lose weight: Harmonized 90 kg.
Although he had nothing to change in his lifestyle for years, he was finally afraid of doctors.
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And it took it.
Goodman gradually agreed 90 kilograms, which is half of its original weight 180 kg, informs The Sun.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the thickness of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different man!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his big body caused cracking furniture.
"I all shook in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Fuck, exercise.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use in.
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it would be a formal and, perhaps, a university text, I would probably be looking for how boss would rather describe or explain.
There are more types of boss to all.
The game like Dark Souls, etc. has a few boss that yeah, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of the given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games are hidden by boss (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat at all so that the game or level is completed, but are often even stronger than standard boss.
Then you need Half-Life games where the boss are, but the player is not directly scared with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called at all?
And then they are mini boss.
It is unambiguously unambiguous to translate boss simply probably nowhere, Czech and neither other languages do not solve it (interestingly, only Catalan, which bosse translates as the final opponent).
It is shortly for a story or game generally important, computer control, enemy stronger than all previous and watching completion of some level or task.
After the disappeared Peter of London, the whole world is looking for.
Czech police also participated.
After Peter Srnc's disappearance, the British police have been patrolling since December 3.
Czech police also participated in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking for since December 7.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petro Srnc saw her colleagues last November 28.
The British police belongs to it from 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circuit breaker.
The whole world looks after Peter.
"The Czech police works closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
“We share information together for the case,” she added.
The announced search for Peter appeared on the police website.
According to him, 168 centimeters are high, it is weighted and has brown eyes and long straight hair the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues fear her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman also participated in the search for Petro.
She participated in the drawing of flyers with Petra's face.
“We have tremendous concerns about it,” she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British policemen have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear about whom it was and what he had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic terrorizes the Tesla Agent.
While data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns in October, last month, the attacks were significantly reinforced by the end of the year.
We witnessed a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same so far.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should draw attention to the names that refer to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month it had a dangerous attachment to the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the receipt correction for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Irkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Any code actively searches for saved login data that is subsequently sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the coming holidays and end of the year attackers will grow again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook was slightly weakened in November, but it remains worth a few fifths of all detections.
Attacks continued throughout the month with increased activities on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contains the most common attachment to the .exe file extension that was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and suppressive activity are recorded by security analysts at Fareit, who stood at 1.6 per cent of attacks and had no more attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.

The conduct of Prague was larger than the media indicate.
According to the shoots of the wire on the shore and according to my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of estimated about 10 thousand people.
People in the wire filled the shores and bridges and opposite the coastal communications.
This means that people are really a lot.
About four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the conduct of the unexpected number of surroundings.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek Wet.
That the dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population persisted resulted in a common speech.
Only anti-vaxers, anti-riskers and spol. would such a large wire not be able to fill or pay.
The actions of the Chcipl dog have an ascending popularity, reminding me of a million of moments for democracy of naruby.
Sometimes I have such an impression that they rent the same podium and technique.
It is difficult to say what movement would be dissatisfied with this dissatisfaction, not only depends on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become a square or more dose.
It will certainly not move left or middle, bet it.
The triple-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose, because it is apparent that we will have to be vaccinated every half of the year.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
Genial action of scientists on whom humanity is proud.

In Britain, there were concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czechs, after which the London police have been looking for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home to the southern British metropolis.
According to information about children's hospital workers, in addition to the police and its current employer or a member representing a part of London, where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior and we begin to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where she worked.
“Their family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns and in short wants to know where they are,” she continued.
According to her on Sunday 28 November, about 19:45 she left her work and headed home to Camberwell district.
The last time was reportedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by some of their colleagues.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a "Healthcare Assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
